The Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP was sent for review in July 2024 to improve the quality of the 
guideline, to gather feedback on the draft recommendations and to assess feasibility for and applicability to 
the target audience, including assessing the facilitators and barriers to implementing recommendations (e.g., 
U.S. ophthalmologists and other important groups, including patients, other physicians, international 
ophthalmologists, research organizations, ophthalmological organizations, and experts in the field). The PPP 
was sent for review to the following patient organizations to solicit the views and preferences of patients and 
the public: Consumers United for Evidence-Based Healthcare, American Foundation for the Blind, 
Foundation Fighting Blindness, Lighthouse Guild, National Federation of the Blind, and Prevent Blindness. 
All those returning comments were required to provide disclosure of relevant relationships with industry to

OBJECTIVES OF PREFERRED PRACTICE 
PATTERN® GUIDELINES 
As a service to its members and the public, the American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed a series 
of Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that identify characteristics and components of quality eye care. 
Appendix 1 describes the core criteria of quality eye care. 
The Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are based on the best available scientific data as interpreted by 
committees of knowledgeable health professionals. In some instances, such as when results of carefully 
conducted clinical trials are available, the data are particularly persuasive and provide clear guidance. In 
other instances, the committees have to rely on their collective judgment and evaluation of available 
evidence. 
These documents provide guidance for the pattern of practice, not for the care of a particular 
individual. While they should generally meet the needs of most patients, they cannot possibly best meet the 
needs of all patients. Adherence to these PPPs will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation. These 
practice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods 
of care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results. It may be necessary to approach different patients’ 
needs in different ways. The physician must make the ultimate judgment about the propriety of the care of a 
particular patient in light of all of the circumstances presented by that patient. The American Academy of 
Ophthalmology is available to assist members in resolving ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of 
ophthalmic practice. 
Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are not medical standards to be adhered to in all individual 
situations. The Academy specifically disclaims any and all liability for injury or other damages of any kind, 
from negligence or otherwise, for any and all claims that may arise out of the use of any recommendations or 
other information contained herein. 
References to certain drugs, instruments, and other products are made for illustrative purposes only and are 
not intended to constitute an endorsement of such. Such material may include information on applications 
that are not considered community standard, that reflect indications not included in approved U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, or that are approved for use only in restricted research settings. The 
FDA has stated that it is the responsibility of the physician to determine the FDA status of each drug or 
device he or she wishes to use, and to use them with appropriate patient consent in compliance with 
applicable law. 
Innovation in medicine is essential to ensure the future health of the American public, and the Academy 
encourages the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic methods that will improve eye care. It is 
essential to recognize that true medical excellence is achieved only when the patients’ needs are the foremost 
consideration. 
All Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are reviewed by their parent committee annually or earlier if 
developments warrant and updated accordingly. To ensure that all PPPs are current, each is valid for 5 years 
from the approved by date unless superseded by a revision. Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are funded 
by the Academy without commercial support. Authors and reviewers of PPPs are volunteers and do not 
receive any financial compensation for their contributions to the documents. The PPPs are externally 
reviewed by experts and stakeholders, including consumer representatives, before publication. The PPPs are 
developed in compliance with the Council of Medical Specialty Societies’ Code for Interactions with 
Companies. The Academy has Relationship with Industry Procedures (available at www.aao.org/about-
preferred-practice-patterns) to comply with the Code.  
Appendix 2 contains the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 
(ICD) codes for the disease entities that this PPP covers. The intended users of the Age-Related Macular 
Degeneration PPP are ophthalmologists.

METHODS AND KEY TO RATINGS 
Preferred Practice Pattern® guidelines should be clinically relevant and specific enough to provide useful 
information to practitioners. Where evidence exists to support a recommendation for care, the 
recommendation should be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence. To accomplish these 
aims, methods from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network1 (SIGN) and the Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation2 (GRADE) group are used. GRADE is a 
systematic approach to grading the strength of the total body of evidence that is available to support 
recommendations on a specific clinical management issue. Organizations that have adopted GRADE include 
SIGN, the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Policy, and the American 
College of Physicians.3 
All studies used to form a recommendation for care are graded for strength of evidence individually, and
that grade is listed with the study citation.
To rate individual studies, a scale based on SIGN1 is used. The definitions and levels of evidence to rate
individual studies are as follows:
I++ 
High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or 
RCTs with a very low risk of bias 
I+ 
Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias 
I-
Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of bias
II++ 
High-quality systematic reviews of case-control or cohort studies  
High-quality case-control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a 
high probability that the relationship is causal 
II+ 
Well-conducted case-control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a 
moderate probability that the relationship is causal 
II-
Case-control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that
the relationship is not causal
III 
Nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series) 
Recommendations for care are formed based on the body of the evidence. The body of evidence quality
ratings are defined by GRADE2 as follows:
Good quality 
Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of 
effect 
Moderate quality 
Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the 
estimate of effect and may change the estimate 
Insufficient quality 
Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in 
the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate 
Any estimate of effect is very uncertain 
Key recommendations for care are defined by GRADE2 as follows:
Strong 
recommendation 
Used when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the 
undesirable effects or clearly do not 
Discretionary 
recommendation 
Used when the trade-offs are less certain—either because of low-quality evidence 
or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely 
balanced 
The Highlighted Findings and Recommendations for Care section lists points determined by the
Retina/Vitreous PPP Committee to be of particular importance to vision and quality of life outcomes.
Recommendations for care in this PPP were rated using the system described above. Ratings are embedded
throughout the PPP main text in italics.
Literature searches to update the PPP were undertaken on March 6, 2023, January 23, 2024, and August
7, 2024 in PubMed. Complete details of the literature searches are available online at www.aao.org/ppp.
Relevant systematic reviews were identified by the Cochrane Eys and Vision US Satellite (CEV@US).
These systematic reviews were screened by the committee and rated using the system described above by
the committee methodologist.


Recommendations are based on systematic reviews, as per the Institute of Medicine (Clinical Practice
Guidelines We Can Trust, 2011). In formulating the recommendations, the health benefits, side
effects/harms/risks, and the balance of benefits and risks are reviewed and considered. Final decisions are
arrived at through informal consensus techniques. If there are areas of disagreement, a vote will be
conducted among the members of the Retina/Vitreous PPP Committee. If there are individuals with
direct financial relationships in the area of disagreement, these individuals will refrain from the vote.

HIGHLIGHTED FINDINGS AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CARE 
Although an estimated 80% of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have non-neovascular 
or atrophic AMD, the neovascular form is responsible for most of the severe vision loss associated with 
AMD. 
Risk factors for the development of advanced AMD include smoking, increasing age, northern European 
ancestry, and genetic factors. Cigarette smoking has been identified as the primary modifiable risk factor in 
numerous studies on advanced AMD. It is strongly recommended to advise patients with AMD or those at 
risk for AMD to stop smoking. Routine genetic testing is not currently recommended. 
In light of all of the available information on aspirin use and AMD, the current preferred practice for patients 
who have been instructed by their physician that long-term aspirin is appropriate and beneficial is to continue 
with aspirin therapy as prescribed. 
There is no evidence-based treatment for early AMD. 
According to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS2), antioxidant vitamin and mineral 
supplementation should be considered in patients with intermediate AMD or geographic atrophy (GA) in one 
or both eyes and other advanced AMD in one eye. There is no evidence to support the use of these 
supplements for patients who have less than intermediate AMD and no evidence of any prophylactic value 
for family members without signs of AMD. A Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of 
developing AMD and of existing AMD becoming worse. 
Early detection and prompt treatment of active neovascular AMD improves visual outcomes. Intravitreal 
injection therapy using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, which may or may not target 
other factors such as placental growth factor or angiopoietin-2, is the most effective way to manage 
neovascular AMD and is the first-line treatment. Symptoms suggestive of post-injection endophthalmitis or 
retinal detachment require prompt evaluation. 
The choice of biologic product (reference, biosimilar, or interchangeable) should be that of the treating 
ophthalmologist and the patient whenever possible.

INTRODUCTION 
DISEASE DEFINITION 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a spectrum of disorders of the macula characterized by 
one or more of the following:  

Presence of at least medium-size drusen (≥ 63 µm in diameter)

Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) abnormalities such as hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation

Presence of any of the following features: GA of the RPE, choroidal neovascularization ([CNV]
exudative, wet), reticular pseudodrusen, or retinal angiomatous proliferation
This Preferred Practice Pattern uses the classification of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study
(AREDS) and the Beckman Initiative for Macular Research Classification4 to define the early and
intermediate stages of AMD. The AREDS was a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial
conducted between 1992 and 2006 designed to assess the natural course and risk factors for age-
related cataract and AMD. The effects of antioxidant vitamins and minerals on these two ocular
conditions were studied.
The classification of AMD from the AREDS is as follows:5

No AMD (AREDS category 1) represented the control group; it is characterized by no or few small
drusen, also known as drupelets (small drusen ≤ 63 microns).4

Early AMD (AREDS category 2) is characterized by a combination of multiple small drusen, few
intermediate drusen (> 63–124 µm in diameter), or mild RPE abnormalities.

Intermediate AMD (AREDS category 3) is characterized by either of the following features:
 
Numerous medium drusen
 
At least one large druse (≥ 125 µm in diameter)

Advanced AMD (AREDS category 4) is characterized by one or more of the following (in the
absence of other causes) in one eye:
 
GA of the RPE two subtypes: fovea-involving and not involving fovea6
 
Macular neovascularization (MNV) historically referred to as CNV and includes the following:7
o
Type 1 MNV: a neovascular complex located in the sub-RPE space originating
from the choroid through a defect in Bruch’s membrane
o
Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) lesions, similar to Type 1 MNV,
characterized by branching vascular networks with dilated vascular elements
(historically referred to as polyps)
o
Type 2 MNV: a neovascular complex located in the subretinal space above the
RPE originating from the choroid
o
Type 3 MNV: pathologic angiogenesis originating from the deep retinal capillary
plexus and extending to the outer retina (historically referred to as retinal
angiomatous proliferation)
Macular neovascularization can lead to the following: 
o
Serous detachment of the neurosensory retina or RPE
o
Hard exudates (a secondary phenomenon resulting from chronic vascular
leakage)
o
Hemorrhage
o
Intraretinal fluid
o
Subretinal and sub-RPE fibrovascular proliferation
o
Subretinal fibrosis (formerly known as disciform scar)

PATIENT POPULATION 
Patients are typically aged 50 years or older, with or without visual symptoms. Clinicians should 
consider the possibility of hereditary macular dystrophies in patients under 50 years of age who 
have clinical features that resemble AMD.   
CLINICAL OBJECTIVES 

Educate physicians on how to identify patients at risk of vision loss related to AMD

Educate physicians on how to counsel patients and families about the disease, risk factors, and
preventive measures

Minimize or reverse visual loss and functional impairment in these patients through appropriate
detection, self-assessment, treatment, and follow-up examinations
BACKGROUND 
INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE 
Age-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of severe, irreversible vision impairment in 
developed countries.10-15 In 2019, there were an estimated 20 million individuals in the United States 
with AMD; of these, 18.34 million had early stages of AMD and 1.49 million had late stages of 
AMD.16 A previous estimate in 2004 found an estimated 1.75 million people aged 40 years or older 
in the United States have advanced AMD, either neovascular AMD or GA in at least one eye; 7.3 
million were considered to have high-risk features such as large drusen (≥ 125 µm in diameter) in 
one or both eyes.14, 17 Although relatively few cases of advanced AMD occur between the ages of 40 
and 50, detection of earlier AMD stages, which are precursors of more advanced AMD, are not 
uncommon occurrences during this decade. Aging is the greatest risk factor; therefore, the 
prevalence of AMD in the United States is anticipated to increase to 22 million by the year 2050, 
whereas the global prevalence is expected to increase to 288 million by the year 2040.18 Overall, 
AMD is responsible for an estimated 46% of cases of severe visual loss (visual acuity [VA] 20/200 
or worse) in people over age 40 in the United States.15 Age-related macular degeneration is a disease 
spectrum that has early and late stages. Although an estimated 80% of patients with AMD have non-
neovascular or atrophic AMD,11 the neovascular form is responsible for nearly 90% of the severe 
VA loss (20/200 or worse) from AMD because of its natural history.19, 20  
Although the prevalence, incidence, and progression of AMD and most associated features (e.g., 
large drusen) increase with age, the prevalence of AMD also varies by race and ethnicity.15, 21-23 In 
the Beaver Dam Eye Study, consisting of primarily a Caucasian population base, the prevalence of 
any AMD (referred to as age-related maculopathy) was less than 10% in people aged 43 to 54 years 
yet more than tripled for people aged 75 to 85 years.10 The Beaver Dam Eye Study demonstrated 
that the development of any AMD over a 10-year period was 4.2% for people 43 to 54 years old and 
46% for those 75 and older.24 The Beaver Dam Eye Study has identified that soft, indistinct drusen 
and pigmentary abnormalities also increase in frequency with increasing age and are strongly 
predictive of progression to more advanced AMD. In the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, prevalence 
of advanced AMD increased from 0% in individuals 40 to 49 years old to 8.5% in those 80 years old 
and older.25 The Proyecto Vision Evaluation and Research study of Hispanic participants in Arizona 
found that the prevalence of advanced AMD increased from 0.1% in persons 50 to 59 years old to 
4.3% in those 80 and older.26 
Observations from the Barbados Eye Study,27 the Baltimore Eye Study,28 and the Macular 
Photocoagulation Study (MPS)29 suggest that late stages of AMD are more common among 
Caucasian individuals. Findings from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis also suggest that 
neovascular AMD may be more common in Caucasian individuals than in African American 
individuals.22 In Asian populations, there are racial variations in the prevalence of early and late 
AMD, and Caucasian and Asian populations are at higher risk than Hispanic and African 
individuals.30-35 A meta-analysis and systematic review reported a higher prevalence of AMD in

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P14 
European individuals than in Asian or African individuals, with no difference in prevalence between 
Asian and African individuals.18  
RISK FACTORS 
The main unmodifiable risk factors for the development of advanced AMD are increasing age, 
Northern European ancestry, and genetic factors. Although a number of modifiable risk factors have 
been investigated, cigarette smoking is the main one that has been consistently identified in 
numerous studies.36-45 Importantly, it is essential to recognize that the associations found in 
observational studies that analyze risk factors should not be interpreted as cause and effect. Such 
associations may not necessarily translate into treatment recommendations, as multiple confounding 
variables may not be accounted for in the studies.  
Smoking, Hypertension, and Cardiovascular Disease 
Smoking significantly increases the risk of AMD and there appears to be a dose-response 
relationship, because the odds ratio increases with an increased number of pack-year 
exposure.38, 46 Smoking cessation is associated with a reduced risk of AMD progression; the 
risk of developing AMD in individuals who have not smoked for more than 20 years is 
comparable to the risk in nonsmokers.38 Thus, smoking cessation is strongly recommended 
when advising patients, as it represents a key and important modifiable risk factor. A number 
of case-control and population-based studies have examined the relationship between AMD, 
hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases, and they have shown conflicting results.21, 47-
53 Passive smoking exposure was associated with an increased risk of AMD (odds ratio 
1.87%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–3.40) in nonsmokers.38  
Levels of Antioxidants 
Additional risk factors may include low systemic levels of antioxidants. Data from 
observational studies have been inconsistent in identifying low levels of plasma and dietary 
antioxidants of vitamins C and E, carotenoids (e.g., lutein, zeaxanthin), and zinc as risk 
factors for AMD.54-60 The original AREDS results demonstrated a beneficial effect for the use 
of high-dose oral antioxidant vitamins (vitamins C, E, beta-carotene) and zinc 
supplementation in reducing progression of intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in the 
fellow eye to advanced AMD by 25%.61 However, additional vitamin E supplementation 
above the AREDS levels should be avoided.62 Results of AREDS2 support the removal of 
beta-carotene (found in the original AREDS supplements) and the addition of 
lutein/zeaxanthin in the AREDS2 supplements.63 Furthermore, elimination of the beta-
carotene component may reduce the competitive absorption of the lutein/zeaxanthin. 
Importantly, removal of beta-carotene may eliminate the increased incidence of lung cancer 
associated with the use of supplemental beta-carotene.64 Finally, AREDS2 demonstrated that 
there was no effect on the progression of AMD by either reducing the zinc dose (from 80 mg 
to 25 mg) or adding an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplement (docosahexaenoic acid 
[DHA] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]).64 A Cochrane systematic review concluded that 
taking antioxidant vitamins plus zinc probably slows the progression to late AMD and vision 
loss (moderate-certainty evidence). This review also concluded that supplements containing 
only lutein and zeathanthin may have little or no effect on the progression of AMD.65  
Diet 
Several studies have also identified an association between dietary fat and advanced AMD.39, 66-
72 Similar to the reports on risk factors for cardiovascular disease, a number of reports from 
population-based studies have demonstrated that a reduced risk of AMD is associated with 
higher dietary intake of foods rich in omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as 
fish.39, 70, 71, 73, 74 In a nested cohort study from the original AREDS population of 1837 patients 
who were at moderate risk for progression, participants who reported the highest omega-3 
intake (note that this was not in the form of a supplement) were 30% less likely to develop

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P15 
advanced AMD after 12 years.71 These dietary long-chain fatty acids are thought to decrease 
inflammatory mediators via immunomodulation, thus decreasing disease progression to 
advanced AMD.71 An increased risk of AMD was found in individuals who had a higher intake 
of saturated fats and cholesterol and in those with a higher body mass index.43 Despite this 
dietary association, AREDS2 failed to demonstrate a benefit from the use of DHA and EPA as 
oral supplements at the doses tested; both are omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids.64 The EYE-
RISK consortium published their evaluation of the pooled data from the Rotterdam Study-1 and 
the Alienor Study populations, which included more than 4000 participants with mean follow-
up of 9.9 years and 4.1 years, respectively, and adherence to Mediterranean diet was associated 
with a 41% reduced risk of advanced AMD. The Mediterranean diet includes a diet rich in 
fruits, vegetables, legumes, and fish.75, 76 Follow-up of the AREDS1 and AREDS2 cohorts 
found that closer adherence to a Mediterranean-type diet was associated with reduced risk of 
progression to large drusen and late AMD.77 A post hoc analysis of AREDS2 found that slower 
GA enlargement was associated with a Mediterranean type diet.78 
Aspirin 
Observational studies have indicated a possible link between aspirin use and AMD. The Beaver 
Dam Eye Study reported two times the incidence of late macular degeneration in patients who 
used aspirin at least twice weekly for 10 years compared with those who used no aspirin.79, 80 
Other studies have shown a potential protective effect of aspirin against the development of 
AMD.81 In a meta-analyses of 10 studies, the use of aspirin was not associated with an increased 
risk of AMD,82 but another meta-analysis of 16 studies identified an association with aspirin in a 
subgroup of studies with long-term follow-up.83 In light of all of the available information on 
aspirin use and AMD, the current preferred practice for patients who have been instructed by 
their physician to use aspirin is to continue their aspirin therapy as prescribed.84, 85  
Genetic Factors 
Molecular genetic studies and epidemiologic studies have determined some of the genetic factors 
in AMD.86-92 Several studies published in 2005 identified a strong association of the complement 
factor H (CFH) Y402H polymorphism with a higher risk of AMD.93-98 The CFH gene product is 
involved in regulation of the complement system through binding to factor C3b. This specific 
complement factor represents a key regulator of the innate rather than the adaptive immune 
system. An alteration of regulation that occurs from modification at the C3b site leads to a 
defective regulation of the alternative complement pathway and results in an up-regulation of 
inflammation to host cells that are mediated by the membrane attack complex. Patients who are 
homozygous for the Y402H risk allele of CFH possess a 7.4-fold increased risk of AMD. The 
CFH gene is located on chromosome 1, in a region linked to AMD in multiple family studies.93 
Studies report an association of a CFH variant (homozygous individuals) with other factors for 
the risk of progression to advanced AMD compared with noncarriers who lack these 
determinants.99, 100 Other factors associated with abnormal complement variants and AMD 
progression include an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an elevated serum C-reactive 
protein, and smoking. Such findings support the combined pathogenic mechanisms for AMD 
progression that include an interplay of environmental factors, heredity, and inflammation. 
Strong linkage disequilibrium has been shown across the ARMS2-HTRA1 region, and these two 
genes are also strongly associated with AMD.101-103 The exact mechanism that explains this 
association has not been clearly determined.104 Other proposed genetic variants associated with 
AMD include a variant in the hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene105 and the rs3775291 variant in the toll-
like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene.106, 107 A number of other genes have also been identified as well as 
several other rare variants of genes.108 A combination of genes and other risk factors may 
dispose an individual to varying AMD risks more than any one variant taken in isolation.109 A 
genome-wide association study has identified 19 loci (P < 5x10-8), seven of which are newly 
described.110  
Age-related macular degeneration has a complex genetic background with similar phenotypes. 
Many genetic associations have been identified—some are protective,111 some are associated

with disease progression, and others have been reported yet not confirmed and require further 
investigation.  
In 2013, several authors proposed that genetic selection of subjects who would most benefit 
from nutritional supplementation should be used to guide therapy based on a post hoc analysis of 
a subset of the AREDS population. Thus, the authors recommend using a personalized genetic 
testing approach to guide therapy in AMD.112, 113 However, an analysis of the AREDS 
population that included an additional 526 AREDS subjects concluded that genetic testing does 
not provide benefits in managing nutritional supplements in this population.114-116 Statistical 
experts found errors in the data used to support an association and bias in the analyses used to 
support genetic testing. They concluded that there was no evidence to support the need for 
genotyping to guide recommendations for use of supplements containing antioxidants and zinc 
in AMD.117  
A prospective, multicenter study looked at genome-wide associations with treatment outcomes 
in a cohort of 465 patients with exudative AMD who were initiating ranibizumab therapy.118 
Although there was no association of any single-nucleotide polymorphism with 12-month 
treatment outcomes (i.e., achieving a dry macula, requiring additional treatment, and VA 
change), the authors found preliminary evidence of a predictive association of the 
ARMS/HTRA1 polymorphism with the need for additional treatment. They postulated that 
testing for this polymorphism might be able to predict the frequency of injection after initial 
ranibizumab therapy. However, a systematic review published in 2015 looked at the association 
between anti-VEGF response and variations in AMD-associated genes; it concluded that genetic 
background may influence an individual’s response to treatment, however further studies are 
needed to better understand the contribution of various genes to treatment response.119, 120 
Currently, only post hoc analysis data are available, and results are conflicting.121 One or more 
prospective clinical trials will need to demonstrate the value of genetic testing in AMD. Thus, 
the routine use of genetic testing is not supported by the existing literature and is not 
recommended at this time.122 Other variants are being studied, but there is insufficient evidence 
to make recommendations at this time.123, 124  
Other Risk Factors 
An increased waist/hip ratio for men has been associated with an increase in the risk of both 
early and late AMD.125 Markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein, may be associated 
with a higher risk of AMD progression.126-128 Other possible factors that have been considered in 
various studies, with inconclusive findings, include hormonal status,129-133 sunlight exposure,134-
136 alcohol use,137-139 and vitamins B and D status.140, 141 A Cochrane systematic review in 2016 
concluded that there was insufficient evidence to define a role of statins in the onset or 
progression of AMD.142  
NATURAL HISTORY 
Normal Aging Changes 
Normal age-related changes develop in the macula that are distinct from AMD. A 2013 study
reported that the presence of small drusen measuring 63 microns or less, referred to as 
drupelets, and the absence of RPE pigmentary abnormalities are consistent with normal aging 
in patients over 55 years of age and do not carry an increased risk of vision loss due to AMD.4 
However, patients with normal aging changes can develop AMD over time.   
Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
As defined by the AREDS, early AMD (category 2) is characterized by small drusen (< 63 
µm in diameter), few medium drusen (63–125 µm in diameter), and/or minimally detected or 
no pigment epithelial abnormalities in the macula. Patients in this category have a low risk of

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P17 
progressing to advanced AMD after 5 years in either eye.5 The AREDS study group published 
a report based on 10-year follow-up data obtained from approximately 85% of the originally 
enrolled patients.143 In the group with a combination of small drusen or no drusen at baseline, 
approximately 15% developed large drusen at 10 years.143 
Intermediate Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
Intermediate AMD (category 3) is a more critical distinction clinically because it places the 
individual at risk for progression to more advanced AMD. It has been defined by the AREDS 
as having extensive medium drusen (63–124 µm in diameter) or one or more large drusen 
(≥ 125 µm in diameter) in one or both eyes. The progression to advanced AMD at 5 years in 
this group is approximately 18% according to the original AREDS. However, for patients 
with large drusen in one eye, the rate of development of advanced AMD at 5 years is 6.3%, 
whereas the rate for patients with multiple bilateral large drusen increases to 26% at 5 years.5, 
144 In the 10-year follow-up study of the AREDS, 37% of patients developed large drusen 
when medium drusen were present at baseline in one eye, and 71% developed large drusen 
when medium drusen were present in both eyes at baseline.143 When medium drusen were 
present at baseline, 14% progressed to advanced AMD at 10 years. 
In 2005, a simplified severity scale was developed for assessing AMD risk progression that is 
based on two primary ophthalmoscopic features: one or more large drusen (≥ 125 µm in 
diameter) and the presence of pigmentary changes.145 Individuals with two affected eyes 
could then be given a five-step grading score of 0–4 (based on one point for each factor being 
present in each eye). The following scores enable the clinician to communicate with the 
patient about the approximate 5-year risk for developing advanced AMD: four factors, 45%; 
three factors, 26%; two factors, 9%; one factor, 4%; and zero factors, 0.5%. The approximate 
10-year risks were 71%, 53%, 28%, 8%, and 1.5%, respectively.143
For patients without large drusen, the presence of intermediate drusen in both eyes is 
considered to represent one risk factor using this severity scale. Advanced AMD in one eye is 
counted as two risk factors. Often, the eye contralateral to the eye with advanced AMD has 
large drusen and RPE pigmentary disturbances and therefore has four risk factors, the highest 
risk-level for progression of all patients with AMD (45% by 5 years and 71% by 10 years). 
Interestingly, an online AMD risk calculator that includes phenotype (simplified severity 
scale score described above) and demographic information (age, smoking, and family history 
of AMD) had excellent calibration and overall performance, whereas the addition of specific 
genetic analysis added little to the 9- to 10-year trend for the development of advanced 
AMD.146 
Reticular pseudodrusen (also referred to as subretinal drusenoid deposits) may be under-
recognized.143 They are best imaged using fundus autofluorescence, infrared reflectance, 
and/or spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and they appear to 
represent a meaningful risk factor associated with progression to GA.147-156 (See Glossary.) In 
2024, the AREDS and AREDS2 research groups defined an updated simplified severity scale 
with two modifications: including noncentral geographic atrophy in the advanced AMD 
outcome (rather than as a risk factor), and incorporating the presence of reticular 
pseudodrusen (see Table 1). In patients without reticular pseudodrusen at baseline, the 5-year 
rates of progression to advanced AMD remained similar to those of the original simplified 
severity scale. However, in patients with reticular pseudodrusen at baseline, the 5-year 
progression rates increased to 72%, 59%, 29%, 8%, and 3% for patients with four, three, two, 
one, and zero risk factors, respectively.157

Advanced Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
Advanced AMD is defined in the AREDS as either neovascular AMD or GA involving the 
center of the macula. Eyes classified as category 4 were required to have no advanced AMD 
in the study eye and the fellow eye had to have VA less than 20/32 as a result of AMD 
abnormalities.5 In the AREDS, the risk of progression for patients with advanced AMD in one 
eye to an advanced stage in the fellow eye ranged from 35% to 50% at 5 years, depending 
largely on the phenotype in the better eye.145 In the Beaver Dam Eye Study, approximately 
22% of the fellow eyes of such patients developed neovascular changes or GA involving the 
fovea over 5 years.158 In the Submacular Surgery Trial, these findings were also confirmed 
and further emphasize the value of the simple risk scale.159 In 2013, the Beckman Initiative 
for Macular Research Classification Committee classified advanced AMD as either 
neovascular AMD and/or any GA whether the macula is affected or not.4  
Geographic Atrophy 
The phenotype of GA, the advanced form of non-neovascular AMD, will have one or 
more zones of well-demarcated RPE and/or choriocapillaris atrophy. Drusen and other 
pigmentary abnormalities may surround the atrophic areas. Severe VA loss occurs more 
slowly in patients with GA than in patients with neovascular AMD. Geographic atrophy 
involving the foveal center causes approximately 10% of all AMD-related visual loss of 
20/200 or worse.160 The presence of GA in the central 1-mm zone of the macula 
correlates with reduced VA, whereas total geographic atrophy area correlates poorly to 
VA.161 Eyes with GA outside the fovea maintain relatively good VA, yet patients’ quality 
of life can be affected because the inner left subfield is associated with reading and the 
inner lower subfield is associated with distance vision activities.160, 162 Several different 
studies have published GA growth rates that range from 1.28 to 2.6 mm2 per year.163-173 
In the Proxima A and B studies, conversion to GA or CNV in the fellow eye was reported 
in 30%  and 6.7% of patients, respectively, at 12 months with GA or CNV in one eye.165  
Growth rates of multifocal areas of GA increase over time faster than monofocal areas of 
GA.167, 173 Extrafoveal lesions increase at a faster rate compared to foveal lesions.173 
Larger areas of GA have greater rates of enlargement compared with smaller areas of 
GA.171 In cases of bilateral GA, the enlargement rates of the two eyes have high 
concordance.170, 171 Neovascular AMD also may occur in eyes with GA.150 
Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
Historically, neovascular AMD was characterized by means of fluorescein angiography 
as either classic, occult, predominantly classic, minimally classic, or mixed lesions. 
Serous and/or hemorrhagic detachment of the neurosensory retina or the RPE, and/or 
various stages of an elevated, fibrovascular disciform scar, may also occur.  


--- Página 19 ---

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P19 
In the MPS, classification of neovascular AMD with CNV was based on fluorescein 
angiography. Classic CNV (Gass Type 2 membrane)174-177 is defined as a well-
demarcated hyperfluorescence in the early phase of the angiogram, with progressive 
leakage of dye into the overlying subneurosensory retinal space during the late phases of 
the angiogram. Occult CNV (Gass Type 1 membrane)174-177 is characterized by either a 
fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment (PED) or late leakage of undetermined 
source. A fibrovascular PED is an irregular elevation of the RPE that has accompanying 
stippled hetero-fluorescence or even hypofluorescence early in the angiogram, with 
progressive late leakage in the later stages of the angiogram.  
Other clinical subtypes or features of neovascular AMD may include idiopathic PCV,178, 
179 which should be suspected in patients with orange polypoid lesions and especially in 
African or Asian individuals. The lesions are often located in the peripapillary region, but 
may also present in the central macula or the macular arcades initially as large 
hemorrhagic retinal PED, lipid exudation, and subretinal fluid. An indocyanine green 
(ICG) angiogram is often useful in confirming the diagnosis. Multicolor fundus imaging 
and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to detect some PCV cases as 
well.180 
Optical coherence tomography and OCT angiography allow histology level three-
dimensional descriptions of the three types of MNV and atrophic AMD.7 Classification 
of atrophic AMD based on OCT has led to four proposed histology level categories: 
complete RPE and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA), incomplete RPE and outer retinal 
atrophy (iRORA), complete outer retinal atrophy, and incomplete outer retinal atrophy. 
Longitudinal studies are needed to validate the proposed OCT classifications.181  
RATIONALE FOR TREATMENT 
Randomized, controlled clinical trials support the use of antioxidant supplementation for slowing 
the progression to later stages of AMD; intravitreal injection of complement factor inhibitor to 
decrease the rate of GA growth; and intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents, photodynamic 
therapy (PDT), and laser photocoagulation surgery to treat neovascular AMD. Thermal laser 
photocoagulation surgery is rarely used in clinical practice and is not recommended for subfoveal 
MNV.182 
TREATMENT MODALITIES 
Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
The use of the combination of antioxidant vitamins and minerals did not reduce the 
progression of early AMD to the intermediate stage of AMD, and there was insufficient 
power to determine the effects of the combination treatment on the progression to more 
advanced AMD. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the use of these supplements for 
patients who have less than intermediate AMD. In early AMD (AREDS category 2), only 
1.3% of participants progressed to advanced AMD in 5 years. A meta-analysis in 2012 that 
looked at the evidence about whether taking an antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplement 
prevents the development of AMD concluded that there was accumulating evidence that 
taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will not prevent or delay the onset of AMD.183 
There is no evidence-based treatment for early AMD. 
Intermediate Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
The original AREDS used a factorial design whereby 4757 participants were randomized to 
antioxidant vitamins, zinc, a combination of antioxidant vitamins and minerals (zinc and 
copper), or a placebo, and were followed for a mean of 6 years.5 Of these, 3640 participants 
were enrolled in the study for AMD. In the AREDS, daily doses of vitamin C (500 mg), 
vitamin E (400 IU), beta-carotene (15 mg), zinc (80 mg as zinc oxide), and copper (2 mg as 
cupric oxide, to reduce the risk of zinc-induced copper deficiency anemia) were evaluated. In

the AREDS2, the replacement of beta-carotene with lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) 
was explored, along with a lower dose (25 mg) of zinc oxide (see Table 2).

The AREDS2 study was a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled phase 
3 clinical trial that used a 2 x 2 factorial study design.64 The study enrolled 4203 participants 
with either bilateral large drusen or large drusen in one eye and advanced disease in the fellow 
eye. This population represented a high-risk group for progression to more advanced stages as 
identified in the original AREDS.184 Participants were randomized to receive either 
supplemental lutein and zeaxanthin, supplemental omega-3, or the original formulation. A 
secondary randomization to four variations included elimination of beta-carotene, lower zinc 
levels (25 mg), or both. The results of the AREDS2 support the recommendation for 
substitution of beta-carotene with lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg). 
In the original AREDS and in AREDS2, participants who benefited from antioxidant vitamin 
and mineral supplementation were those who had either intermediate AMD or advanced 
AMD in one eye. For participants with extensive intermediate (i.e., medium-sized) drusen in 
one or both eyes, one or more large drusen in at least one eye, non-subfoveal GA in one eye, 
or advanced AMD (i.e., subfoveal GA or CNV) in one eye, the rate of development of 
advanced AMD at 5 years was reduced by 25% in the participants using the combination 
treatment of antioxidant vitamins with zinc and copper. The risk of losing vision of 3 or more 
lines (doubling of the visual angle) was reduced by 19% with this combination treatment. 
Although zinc alone or antioxidants alone reduced progression, the therapy that resulted in a 
statistically significant reduction in both the development of advanced AMD and vision loss 
was the combination treatment of antioxidant vitamins and minerals (Table 3).

P21 
A meta-analysis in 2017 concluded that individuals with AMD may experience delay in 
progression of the disease with antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation.185 This 
finding is drawn from one large trial conducted in a relatively well-nourished American 
population. The generalizability of these findings to other populations is not known. Although 
generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have side effects.65 A second meta-
analysis was published concluding that taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will 
not prevent or delay the onset of AMD. The same probably applies to vitamin C and the 
multivitamin (Centrum Silver) investigated in the one trial reported to date.185 There is no 
evidence with respect to other antioxidant supplements, such as lutein and zeaxanthin.185 A 
meta-analysis of the adverse effects of nutritional supplementation reported that there is an 
increased risk of death from vitamin A, beta-carotene, and vitamin E supplements (16%, 7%, 
4%, respectively), but not from vitamin C supplements.186 Other investigators have raised 
concerns about the methodology for this meta-analysis. There is potential bias in the analyses 
owing to the omission of clinical trials that had no deaths and the lack of biological 
plausibility in the authors’ interpretation of the results of the subgroup analyses.187-189 Also, a 
number of studies in the meta-analysis used antioxidant dosages much higher than those used 
in the AREDS and did not find an adverse association of high-dose antioxidant 
supplementation.190 Of great concern, two studies reported an increased mortality among 
patients who were heavy smokers and were also taking beta-carotene supplements to prevent 
lung cancer.191, 192 
The AREDS2 study results demonstrated that in patients at high risk for progression there was 
no statistically significant difference associated with supplementation with the original 
AREDS formula versus each of the other modifications on AMD progression. As mentioned 
earlier, the addition of omega-3 supplementation (DHA and EPA) had no further benefit. This 
result was also suggested by a meta-analysis in 2008.74 Subgroup analysis indicated that for 
those in the lowest quartile for lutein and zeaxanthin intake, supplemental lutein and 
zeaxanthin was protective (95% CI, 0.59–0.94; P = 0.01). The authors concluded from all 
available evidence that lutein and zeaxanthin represent an appropriate substitute for beta-
carotene in the supplement.64 Finally, there was no demonstrated detrimental effect of 
lowering the zinc levels (25 mg) on progression to advanced disease.64 A meta-analysis in 
2013 did show that zinc supplementation alone may not be sufficient to produce clinically 
meaningful changes in VA.193 A post hoc analysis of the AREDS and AREDS2 studies in 
2023 evaluated 1602 eyes with GA across the two studies and found that oral micronutrient 
supplementation slowed GA progression toward the central macula, likely by augmenting the 
natural phenomenon of foveal sparing.194  
Other treatment modalities are being investigated. LIGHTSITE I and II and a Cochrane 
review in 2021 did not show a benefit of photobiomodulation,195-197 but a follow-up study, 
LIGHTSITE III in 2024, showed that photobiomodulation appears to decrease the onset of 
new GA (P = 0.02).197, 198 (I-, Insufficient quality) In 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approved a device for multiwavelength photobiomodulation (Valeda® 
Light Delivery System, LumiThera Inc., Poulsbo, WA) treatment of patients with non-
neovascular AMD.199 
Non-Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration with Geographic 
Atrophy  
In 2023, two therapies for non-neovascular AMD with GA were shown to reduce GA growth 
and received regulatory approval. The first was pegcetacoplan 15 mg/0.1ml (SYFOVRE®, 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Waltham, MA), which blocks the C3 and C3b proteins of the 
complement-mediated immune system. In two phase 3 studies, OAKS and DERBY, 1258 
study participants with either foveal-involving or foveal-sparing GA were randomly assigned 
to receive pegcetacoplan monthly, every other month (EOM) or sham.200 In OAKS, the 
primary endpoint at 12 months was met with monthly pegcetacoplan reducing GA growth by 
21% compared with sham and EOM pegcetacoplan reducing GA growth by 16%. At 24 
months, monthly pegcetacoplan and EOM pegcetacoplan reduced the GA growth rate by 22% 
and 18% compared with sham, respectively. In DERBY, at 12 months the primary endpoint 
was

not met with reduced growth rates of 12% in the monthly arm and 11% in the EOM arm 
compared with sham. At 24 months, the growth rates of GA were significantly reduced by 
19% in the monthly arm and 16% in the EOM arm compared with sham. Non-subfoveal GA 
had greater GA growth reductions compared with foveal GA lesions. Subgroup analysis of the 
eyes with non-foveal-involving GA showed reduced growth rates by 26% in the monthly arm 
and 23% in the EOM arm compared with sham. In both trials, there was no difference in 
either treatment arm versus sham for functional testing, including best corrected VA (BCVA), 
mesopic microperimetry, and reading speed. Treatment arms were associated with higher 
rates of developing exudative AMD. In OAKS, at 24 months development of new onset 
exudative AMD was 11%, 8%, and 2% in the monthly, EOM, and sham group, respectively. 
In DERBY, at 24 months development of new onset exudative AMD was 13%, 6%, and 4% 
in the monthly, EOM, and sham group, respectively. In combined OAKS and DERBY, there 
were four cases of endophthalmitis (0.03% per injection at 24 months) and three serious 
adverse events of ischemic optic neuropathy. At 24 months, there was no difference in 
BCVA, reading performance, or microperimetry.200  
Postmarketing surveillance revealed retinal vasculitis occurred at a rate of 0.01% per injection 
and appears to occur more commonly following the first injection at a rate of 1/4000 first 
injections.201, 202 Pegcetacoplan was found to have a 2.1% to 3.8% rate of intraocular 
inflammation (not counting endophthalmitis).201 
The second approved treatment was an avacincaptad pegol intravitreal solution 2 mg 
(Izervay™, Astellas Pharma US, Northbrook IL), a PEGylated, stabilized aptamer that targets 
C5. GATHER2 was a phase 3 clinical trial with 448 study participants with foveal-sparing 
GA.203 Study participants were randomized to either monthly treatment or sham. At 12 
months, square-root-transformed GA area growth rate was reduced by 14% in treated eyes 
versus sham. There was no difference in treatment group versus sham for functional tests of 
BCVA and low luminance BCVA. Exudative MNV developed in 7% in eyes treated with 
avacincaptad pegol compared with a rate of 4% in the sham group. There were no cases of 
endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation, or ischemic optic neuropathy over 12 months. 
Avacincaptad pegol monthly treatment led to a 14% reduction in the mean rate of GA area 
growth at 24 months. For patients treated monthly in the first 12 months, followed by EOM 
for months 13 to 24, there was a 19% reduction in mean GA growth rate at month 24. Rates of 
MNV were 7% in the treatment group compared with 4% in the sham group. Rates of 
exudative MNV were 5% in the treated group and 3% in the sham group. In a post hoc 
analysis, avacincaptad pegol delayed the risk of progression to persistent vision loss (i.e., ≥10-
BCVA letter loss, ≥15-BCVA letter loss, and ≥20-BCVA letter loss or BCVA loss to a level 
below driving eligibility threshold) versus sham over 12 months.204 
There was no benefit for BCVA in the clinical trials for either pegcetacoplan or avacincaptad 
pegol, although the post hoc analysis for avacincaptad pegol suggested a possible slowing of 
progression to persistent vision loss. Because of the risk of exudative AMD, patients should 
be monitored and treated if needed. Pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad pegol are both relatively 
new medications for which long-term, real-world data are lacking. The physician should 
discuss the use of these medications with the patient, based on individual circumstances, 
including documented treatment benefits and risks. 
Exudative Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
Anti-VEGF therapies have become first-line therapy for treating and stabilizing most cases of 
neovascular AMD, and a Cochrane systematic review demonstrates the effectiveness of these 
agents to maintain VA.205 (I++, Good quality, Strong recommendation) (See Appendix 3.) 
Anti-VEGF therapies are discussed below. Adverse events for all anti-VEGF agents include 
rare risks of arterial thromboembolic events, endophthalmitis, and elevated intraocular 
pressure.206-217

Aflibercept 
Aflibercept is a pan VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth factor blocker approved by 
the FDA,213 and the 2-mg dose has been documented to be of similar efficacy to 
ranibizumab in the head-to-head phase-3 VEGF Trap-Eye: Investigation of Efficacy and 
Safety in Wet AMD (VIEW) trials.218 In these pivotal studies, the 2-mg dose of 
aflibercept was administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks and every 8 weeks 
after three monthly loading doses. In the first year, both study arms were similar to 0.5-
mg ranibizumab dosed every 4 weeks. Aflibercept 2 mg was well tolerated and had a 
safety profile comparable to ranibizumab and other anti-VEGF agents. 
The phase 3 PULSAR study evaluated a higher dose of aflibercept, 8 mg, compared with 
aflibercept 2 mg. The 48-week results showed that after three monthly loading doses, 
aflibercept 8 mg showed achieved noninferior VA gains at 12-week and 16-week 
treatment intervals compared with aflibercept 2 mg at 8-week treatment intervals. Even 
though eyes were treated at extended intervals, all eyes were followed monthly and 
treatment intervals were reduced in the aflibercept 8-mg groups if BCVA was reduced by 
5 letters, if the central retinal thickness increased by 25 microns, or if new foveal 
hemorrhage or neovascularization developed. At 48 weeks, 79% of eyes maintained 12-
week dosing intervals and 77% maintained 16-week dosing intervals. The proportion of 
patients without fluid in the center subfield at week 16 was greater in the aflibercept 8- 
mg group (63%) compared with the aflibercept 2-mg group (52%), which was maintained 
through week 48. The mean change from baseline in central retinal thickness was 
numerically greater in the aflibercept 8-mg groups at 48 weeks (-141.9 µm for aflibercept 
8-mg every 12 weeks, -147.1 µm for aflibercept 8-mg every 16 weeks, and -126.3 µm for
aflibercept 2-mg every 8 weeks). The safety profile of aflibercept 8 mg was found to be
similar to that of aflibercept 2 mg. The second year of the study will demonstrate if safety
and efficacy outcomes are maintained for eyes treated every 12 weeks and 16 weeks.219
Bevacizumab 
Bevacizumab is a full-length monoclonal antibody that binds all isoforms of VEGF. It is 
FDA approved for intravenous use in the treatment of metastatic colorectal, metastatic 
breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. Bevacizumab was investigated first as a systemic 
intravenous treatment for AMD and then as an intravitreal injection (1.25 mg) before the 
FDA approved ranibizumab.220, 221 Because preliminary reports appeared favorable, 
ophthalmologists began using intravitreal bevacizumab off-label to treat MNV. 
Comparative trials and uncontrolled case series reported improvements in VA and 
decreased retinal thickness by OCT following intravitreal bevacizumab treatment.222-228 
Informed consent information is available on the benefits and risks of intravitreal 
bevacizumab and its off-label status.229
Brolucizumab 
Brolucizumab 6 mg is a single-chain variable fragment (the smallest functional portion of 
an antibody) that binds VEGF-A and was approved by the FDA for the treatment of 
neovascular AMD.214 Results from the HAWK and HARRIER phase 3 clinical trials 
showed that brolucizumab achieved its primary endpoint of noninferiority of BCVA 
change compared with aflibercept at week 48. Patients treated with brolucizumab 
achieved superior reductions in central subfield thickness compared with aflibercept 2 
mg. Fewer patients treated with brolucizumab had subretinal fluid, inter-retinal fluid, and 
sub-RPE fluid.230 After FDA approval, several cases of occlusive retinal vasculitis 
occurred after intravitreal brolucizumab injection.231 A phase 3a study of brolucizumab 
every 4 weeks for patients with recalcitrant neovascular AMD found noninferior efficacy 
and a greater proportion of fluid-free eyes at week 104 for brolucizumab compared with 
aflibercept 2 mg. However, the incidence of intraocular inflammation, including retinal 
vasculitis and retinal vascular occlusion, was 11.5% for brolucizumab and 6.1% for 
aflibercept.232 Brolucizumab is approved for use every 8 to 12 weeks after the loading 
period, and more frequent administration should be avoided.

Faricimab-svoa 
Faricimab-svoa, a humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody for intravitreal use that acts 
through dual inhibition of both angiopoietin-2 and VEGF-A, was approved by the FDA 
for the treatment of patients with neovascular AMD.215, 233 Angiopoietin-2 is a growth 
factor belonging to the angiopoietin/TIE (tyrosine kinase with Ig and EGF homology 
domains) signaling pathway. The TENAYA and LUCERNE studies showed that patients 
receiving faricimab for neovascular AMD dosed up to every 16 weeks showed 
noninferior VA gains compared with patients receiving aflibercept 2 mg every 8 
weeks.234 Through week 60 of the study, fixed dosing intervals of 8 weeks, 12 weeks, or 
16 weeks were maintained in the faricimab group following assessment of disease 
activity criteria at weeks 20 and 24. After week 60, a personalized treatment interval 
regimen was used. Approximately 80% of eyes could be dosed every 12 weeks or more, 
and 45% could be dosed every 16 weeks in year 1 and increased to 63% in year 2. 
Through year 2, the median number of injections in the faricimab group was 10, 
compared with 15 for aflibercept. In the personalized treatment interval phase (after week 
60), the median number of injections in the faricimab group was 3 and in the aflibercept 
group it was 6.234 Comparable reductions in central subfield thickness were observed in 
the faricimab and aflibercept groups through year 2. There were no new safety signals, 
and adverse events were comparable to aflibercept 2 mg. A faricimab single-dose 
prefilled syringe was FDA approved in 2024.215  
The TRUCKEE study is an ongoing multicenter retrospective review of eyes treated with 
faricimab for neovascular AMD. Six-month results included 376 eyes, 337 of which had 
been previously treated with other anti-VEGF agents with an average of 31.1 prior 
injections. After one and three injections of faricimab, both treatment-naïve and 
previously treated eyes demonstrated maintained or improved BCVA. A significant 
reduction in mean central subfield thickness was observed in treatment-naïve and 
previously treated eyes after one injection and in previously treated eyes after three 
injections.235 
Ranibizumab 
Ranibizumab 0.5-mg was approved by the FDA for the treatment of all subtypes of 
neovascular AMD, based on results from three double-masked, randomized controlled 
trials.217, 236, 237 (See Table 4.) Ranibizumab is a recombinant, humanized immunoglobulin 
G1 kappa isotype therapeutic antibody fragment developed for intraocular use. 
Ranibizumab binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of all isoforms of human VEGF-
A. Ranibizumab was well tolerated in randomized controlled trials with a safety profile 
similar to that of other anti-VEGF agents. 
The FDA approved ranibizumab 100 mg/ml for use with an ocular implant that 
continuously releases the medication over 6 months.216 The implant is surgically inserted 
into the eye in the operating room and can be refilled every 6 months with an office 
procedure. The Archway phase 3 study showed that patients receiving the ranibizumab 
implant had VA gains equivalent to patients receiving monthly ranibizumab injections.238, 
239 Approximately 98% of patients could receive continuous treatment for 6 months 
before requiring a refill or supplemental ranibizumab.239 Importantly, after using the 
implant, there was a 2% risk of endophthalmitis in clinical trials (a rate three times higher 
than monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab). Other risks included vitreous 
hemorrhage, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, implant dislocation, septum 
dislodgement, conjunctival erosion, conjunctival retraction, and conjunctival blebs. In 
2022, the implant was voluntarily recalled due to concerns about septum dislodgment. 
The implant was re-introduced to the market in 2024.  
Other Studies 
The Comparison of AMD Treatment Trials (CATT) study was a multicenter clinical trial 
that compared the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab with ranibizumab and an 
individualized dosing regimen (as needed, or PRN) with monthly injections. At 1 year, 


--- Página 25 ---

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P25 
the CATT study found that ranibizumab and bevacizumab had comparable VA 
improvements for monthly dosing.225 Ranibizumab PRN had similar VA improvements 
compared with a fixed schedule of monthly injections. Further follow-up at 2 years 
showed that the two drugs remained comparable in both efficacy and safety, but the PRN 
arms for both drugs did not perform as well in terms of maintaining the visual gains at the 
end of year 1 compared with the two monthly arms, especially in the bevacizumab PRN 
group.240 The CATT 5-year follow-up study demonstrated that vision gains during the 
first 2 years were not maintained at 5 years. However, 50% of eyes had VA of 20/40 or 
better, confirming anti-VEGF therapy as a major long-term therapeutic advance for 
neovascular AMD.241 Similar results were seen in the 2-year Inhibition of VEGF in Age-
related choroidal Neovascularization (IVAN) trial conducted in the United Kingdom.242, 
243 Presently, there does not appear to be a significant difference in efficacy between 
ranibizumab and bevacizumab.241 A meta-analysis in 2018 of more than 8000 eyes 
comparing aflibercept 2 mg, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab concluded that bevacizumab 
and ranibizumab had equivalent efficacy for BCVA, whereas ranibizumab had greater 
reduction in central macular thickness, and aflibercept and ranibizumab had comparable 
efficacy for BCVA and central macular thickness.244 A review in 2015 also elicited 
similar results.245 The systemic safety data in the CATT and IVAN studies are 
inconclusive and two Cochrane systematic reviews have also concluded that if a 
difference in safety between these anti-VEGF drugs exists, it is minimal.246, 247 (I+, Good 
quality, Strong recommendation) A real-world analysis of 13,859 patients found that all 
three agents improved VA similarly over 1 year.248 
Randomized clinical trials have been performed to study the adjunct use of intravitreal 
corticosteroids and/or anti-VEGF agents in various drug combinations or with verteporfin 
PDT, following the publication of results from uncontrolled case series.249-252 However, 
the data do not currently support the use of combination therapy with corticosteroids, 
especially given the long-term side effects of glaucoma and cataract that are associated 
with corticosteroid use. 
The DENALI and MONT BLANC studies (ranibizumab and verteporfin PDT compared 
with ranibizumab alone) did not show a significant benefit of adding PDT to anti-VEGF 
therapy in new-onset neovascular AMD.253, 254 However, the EVEREST study 
demonstrated that fewer anti-VEGF injections were needed in combination therapy 
compared with anti-VEGF monotherapy in eyes with the PCV variant of neovascular 
AMD.255 A 2017 meta-analysis and systematic review also concluded that treatment of 
PCV by PDT combined with ranibizumab is valuable in improving VA and maintaining 
long-term efficacy but recommended further study.256, 257 A randomized trial of 310 
subjects has shown aflibercept to treat PCV effectively in 85% of patients; 15% required 
PDT for control.257 A 2018 meta-analysis of 16 studies compared 587 patients in the 
monotherapy group with various anti-VEGF agents against 673 patients in the 
combination group and found no statistically significant difference between groups in 
mean BCVA, the proportion of patients who gained 15 or more letters, or central retinal 
thickness at the end of the study.258 However, combination therapy did require fewer anti-
VEGF injections, as noted in other studies with reduced-fluence PDT, demonstrating this 
reduction in the number of injections at a statistically significant level as opposed to the 
standard fluence group.258 Although current practice patterns support anti-VEGF 
monotherapy for exudative neovascular AMD, verteporfin PDT remains approved for the 
treatment of subfoveal lesions and can be used in certain situations. 
Table 4 summarizes the findings from randomized controlled trials of verteporfin PDT 
and VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of subfoveal CNV.  
A randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multicenter clinical trial in the United 
Kingdom investigated the use of 16-Gray stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) combined 
with PRN ranibizumab for patients with chronic active neovascular AMD. At 2 years, a 
mean of 10.7 (standard deviation [SD] 6.3) injections were administered in the SRT 
group, and 13.3 (SD 5.8) injections were administered in patients who had received a 
sham radiation procedure. The SRT group achieved noninferior change in VA compared 
with the sham group. Rates of adverse events were generally similar between the groups.

However, microvascular abnormalities were detected in 35% of the SRT group and 12% 
of the sham group on reading center assessment of multimodal imaging. Further study is 
needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of SRT and the effects of SRT 
combined with other anti-VEGF agents.259 
Biosimilars 
As defined by the FDA, biosimilars are large complex molecules produced by living 
organisms that are similar to an existing molecule.260 To approve a biosimilar, the FDA 
compares the purity, molecular structure, and bioactivity of the biosimilar to the existing 
molecule. The FDA also examines comparative clinical studies to ensure that there are 
“no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar product (also 
called biosimilar) and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, or potency (safety 
and effectiveness).” 261  This abbreviated approval process means that the usual process 
of clinical trials that involve human subjects to determine safety and efficacy of a 
reference molecule is not needed.  
A randomized clinical equivalence trial found that a proposed ranibizumab biosimilar 
product met efficacy for mean changes of BCVA at 8 weeks and OCT central subfield 
thickness at week 4. Safety and immunogenicity profiles were reported to be similar.262 
Post hoc analysis revealed no evidence of immunogenicity affecting clinical efficacy, 
safety, or penetrating keratoplasty profiles.263 There are several biosimilar ranibizumab 
molecules approved by the FDA and others are available in numerous other countries.264 
A study compared ranibizumab 0.5 mg to FYB201 and found it biosimilar in terms of 
clinical efficacy and safety.265 There are no prospective long-term clinical data comparing 
ranibizumab biosimilars to ranibizumab. 
In 2021, the FDA approved the first biosimilar for the treatment of retinal disease, 
ranibizumab-nuna 0.5-mg dosage (Byooviz™, Samsung Bioepis, Incheon, South Korea 
and Biogen Inc., Cambridge MA), based on ranibizumab as the reference molecule for 
the retinal indication that ranibizumab-nuna is interchangeable with ranibizumab for 
treating neovascular AMD. 206 A study found that there was equivalence in primary 
efficacy at 1 year.266 
In 2022, the FDA approved ranibizumab-eqrn 0.5-mg dosage (Cimerli®, Coherus 
Biosciences, Redwood City, CA), based on ranibizumab as the reference molecule for the 
retinal indications that ranibizumab-eqrn is interchangeable with ranibizumab for patients 
with neovascular AMD.207 A 2023 systematic review of ranbizumab biosimilars found 
that they had similar outcomes for treatment of patients with neovascular AMD.267 (I+, 
Moderate quality) 
In 2024, the FDA approved five biosimilars to aflibercept 2 mg as of November 
2024: Aflibercept-jbvf (Yesafili™, Biocon Biologics, Bridgewater, NJ),208 aflibercept-
yszy (Opuviz™, Samsung Bioepis, Incheon, South Korea, and Biogen Inc, Cambridge 
MA),209 aflibercept-mrbb (Ahzantive®, Formycon AG, Martinsried/Planegg, 
Germany),210  aflibercept-abzv (Enzeevu™, Sandoz, Inc., Princeton, NJ), and aflibercept-
ayyh (Pavblu™, Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA).211, 268 All are injected intravitreally as 
a 2-mg solution, and the adverse events appear comparable to aflibercept. The 
recommended dose for all five agents is 2 mg every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks, 
followed by 2 mg every 8 weeks. When used, the choice of biologic product (reference, 
biosimilar, or interchangeable) should be that of the treating ophthalmologist and the 
patient because patients may respond more favorably to one biologic over another.269

Extrafoveal Choroidal Neovascularization 
There still remains a role for laser photocoagulation surgery in eyes with extrafoveal and 
peripapillary CNV lesions as defined by the MPS.174, 273 Although photocoagulation of 
well-demarcated extrafoveal CNV lesions resulted in a substantial reduction in the risk of 
severe visual loss for the first 2 years, recurrence or persistence occurs in approximately 
50% of cases, thus reducing this benefit over the subsequent 3 years of follow-up.174 
After 5 years of follow-up, 48% of eyes treated for extrafoveal lesions progressed to VA 
loss of 30 or more letters when compared with 62% of untreated eyes.174 The historical 
data are important to recognize in current practice patterns, because none of the anti-
VEGF or PDT trials included extrafoveal lesions. Practitioners have extrapolated data 
from the dramatic improvements seen in the treatment of subfoveal lesions and applied it 
to extrafoveal lesions. The current trend is to use anti-VEGF agents in preference to laser 
photocoagulation surgery.  
Current therapies that have insufficient data to demonstrate clinical efficacy for treatment 
of CNV lesions include radiation therapy, acupuncture, electrical stimulation, macular 
translocation surgery, and adjunctive use of intravitreal corticosteroids with verteporfin 
PDT. Therefore, currently, these therapies have not proven to be beneficial. 
The risk for progression of AMD and the treatments by severity level are shown in Table 
5 according to the stage of AMD.

CARE PROCESS 
PATIENT OUTCOME CRITERIA 
Patient outcome criteria are to reverse or minimize visual loss and improve visual function. 
DIAGNOSIS 
The initial evaluation of a patient with signs and symptoms suggestive of AMD includes all features 
of the comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation,274 with particular attention to those aspects 
relevant to AMD. 
History 
An initial history should consider the following elements: 
Symptoms275 
 Metamorphopsia
 Decreased vision
 Scotoma
 Photopsia
 Difficulties in dark adaptation
Medication and nutritional supplement use
Ocular history13, 276, 277 
Medical history13, 276, 277 (including any hypersensitivity reactions278, 279)
Family history, especially family history of AMD89, 280
Social history, especially a quantitative smoking history 38-42
Examination 
Comprehensive eye examination
Amsler grid
Stereoscopic biomicroscopic examination of the macula
Binocular slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the ocular fundus is often necessary to detect subtle
clinical signs of MNV. These include small areas of hemorrhage, hard exudates, subretinal
fluid, macular edema, subretinal fibrosis, or pigment epithelial elevation.
Diagnostic Tests 
Optical Coherence Tomography 
Optical coherence tomography is important in diagnosing and managing AMD, particularly 
with respect to determining the presence of subretinal and intraretinal fluid and in 
documenting the degree of retinal thickening.281 Optical coherence tomography defines the 
cross-sectional architecture of the retina, which is not possible with any other imaging 
technology. It may reveal the presence of fluid that is not apparent on biomicroscopy alone. 
It also helps in evaluating the response of the retina and RPE to therapy by allowing 
structural changes to be followed accurately.282-285 Newer-generation OCT modalities, 
including SD-OCT and swept-source (SS) OCT, are preferred technologies. Advances in 
OCT have increased the image resolution and enhanced our ability to detect structural 
changes of the retina and choroid.286-289 The implementation of newer technologies, such as 
SS-OCT, is evolving at this time.287-289 


--- Página 33 ---

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P33 
Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography 
Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a noninvasive imaging modality 
that provides evaluation of the retinal and choroidal vasculature; it is becoming more 
commonly applied in the evaluation and management of AMD, but it has not replaced 
other angiographic methods.290 Sensitivity and specificity for MNV detection with en face 
OCTA combined with cross-sectional OCTA approaches the gold standard of specificity 
and sensitivity of fluorescein angiography with OCT, and it is better than en face OCTA 
alone.291 A meta-analysis of OCTA for detection of MNV revealed a sensitivity of 0.87 and 
specificity of 0.97.290 Structural OCT alone has excellent sensitivity for MNV detection. 
False positives from the structural OCT can be mitigated with the addition of flow 
information with OCTA.291 Optical coherence tomography angiography may detect 
subclinical MNV, which needs close monitoring and not treatment.236, 290, 292, 293  
Fluorescein Angiography 
Intravenous fundus fluorescein angiography may be indicated174, 176, 177 when the patient 
complains of new metamorphopsia or has unexplained blurred vision, and/or when clinical 
examination reveals elevation of the RPE or retina, macular edema, subretinal blood, hard 
exudates, or subretinal fibrosis, or the OCT shows evidence of fluid. Fluorescein 
angiography is also warranted as follows: 
To detect the presence of and determine the extent, type, size, and location of MNV. If
verteporfin PDT or laser photocoagulation surgery is being considered, the angiogram is
used as a guide to direct treatment. The role and indications for fluorescein angiography are
evolving as continued advances in OCT occur.
To detect persistent or recurrent MNV or other retinal diseases following treatment.
To assist in determining the cause of visual loss that is not explained by the clinical
examination.
If MNV is suspected on the basis of new symptoms or ocular findings, fluorescein
angiography should be performed and interpreted expeditiously by an individual
experienced in managing patients with neovascular AMD.174, 176, 177
When fluorescein angiography is performed, the physician must be aware of potential risks
associated with this procedure:294, 295 tissue infiltration (if the drug extravasates the vein),
pain, and allergic reactions. Even death from anaphylaxis has been reported (approximately
1 in 200,000 patients). Each angiographic facility should have a care plan in place for an
emergency situation as well as a clear protocol to minimize the risks and to manage
complications. Of note, fluorescein crosses the placenta and it is present in breastmilk for
72 hours.296, 297
Fundus Photography
Color fundus photographs may be obtained when angiography is performed, because they
are useful in finding landmarks, evaluating serous detachments of the neurosensory retina
and RPE, and determining the etiology of blocked fluorescence. Fundus photographs may
also be used as a baseline reference for selected patients with advanced non-neovascular
AMD and for follow-up of treated patients.
Fundus Autofluorescence
Fundus autofluorescence is helpful to demonstrate areas of GA and monitor their
progression. Some patterns of autofluorescence may predict faster rates of GA.298 Also,
fundus autofluorescence may be used to quantify lipofuscin in the RPE.298

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P34 
Indocyanine Green Angiography 
Indocyanine green angiography allows visualization of the choroidal circulation. The value 
of this test in evaluating and treating AMD has been debated.299 Indocyanine green 
angiography has been shown to be useful in evaluating specific forms of AMD, such as 
PED, poorly defined MNV, occult MNV, and lesions including retinal angiomatous 
proliferation or idiopathic PCV.300, 301 The PCV form of neovascular AMD may be more 
easily identified when ICG is used, particularly in patients of African or Asian descent.14, 
302 When ICG angiography is performed, the physician must be aware of potential risks 
associated with this procedure: severe medical complications, allergic reactions, and even 
death.303 Indocyanine green does not cross the placenta and is generally safe in pregnancy. 
Other Tests 
Several other tests including microperimetry304 (to measure macular sensitivity), and 
adaptive optics (to identify individual rods and cones)305 have been used to evaluate 
patients with AMD; however, their specific role in clinical practice has yet to be 
specifically defined. Artificial intelligence is being evaluated as an adjunct in clinical 
practice to monitor and predict disease progression in AMD.306-308  
MANAGEMENT 
Consequences of untreated neovascular AMD include a substantial economic burden on patients, their 
family, and society. Anti-VEGF agents are cost-effective for the management of neovascular AMD, 
and the choice of which agent to use should be individually tailored based on discussion between the 
patient and physician. Early detection and treatment of AMD to arrest the deterioration in vision may 
help preserve patients’ quality of life and independence. Management options for AMD include 
observation, antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements, intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents, 
PDT, and laser photocoagulation surgery. Several new treatments such as stem cells and gene therapy 
are currently under investigation.309-311   
Patients who are currently smoking should be advised to stop.312, 313 Studies have found that the 
physician’s advice to stop smoking is a helpful motivator for patients who are attempting to quit313 
and is associated with increased long-term smoking abstinence rates.314 An important component of 
care for a patient with AMD is referral for vision rehabilitation as well as continued follow-up for 
general eye care. 
Monitoring and Early Detection 
Patients with early AMD and/or a family history of AMD should be encouraged to assess their 
own VA using monocular vision testing (i.e., Amsler grid or electronic home monitoring315, 316) 
and have scheduled dilated eye examinations for detecting the intermediate stage of AMD. 
Treatment with antioxidants and minerals as described previously in the original AREDS and 
AREDS2 trials should be considered for patients who have progressed to intermediate or 
advanced AMD in at least one eye.  
Patients with a high-risk AMD phenotype are at increased risk of progression to advanced 
AMD and should be educated about methods of detecting new symptoms of MNV, including 
self-monitoring. They should also be educated about the need for promptly reporting new 
symptoms to an ophthalmologist who can confirm if the new symptoms are from MNV and 
who can begin any necessary treatment.  
Follow-up examinations of patients at increased risk of progression to advanced AMD may 
enable (1) early detection of asymptomatic and treatable neovascular lesions that could improve 
or preserve VA, (2) education about the possible benefit of AREDS2-based nutritional 
supplements, and (3) reinforcement of the need for self-monitoring and prompt evaluation with 
the onset of new symptoms. Patients who check monocular near vision (reading/Amsler 
grid/Amsler-grid equivalent) may be more likely to become aware of subtle visual symptoms

due to MNV, increasing the likelihood of detecting MNV at an early stage which, on average, 
yields better long-term visual outcomes with treatment compared with neovascular disease 
detected at a more advanced stage. 
Electronic monitoring devices are now available to aid in the detection of neovascularization at 
an early stage. Such devices use hyperacuity perimetry (or vernier acuity) to create a quantified 
central visual map of metamorphopsia.317 Further studies of a variety of such devices are 
ongoing.317-319  
Indications for Treatment for Macular Neovascularization 
Assessment and treatment plans for non-neovascular and neovascular AMD are listed in Table 
6. The criteria for treatment of AMD and the techniques of therapy are described in the anti-
VEGF agent, MPS, and AREDS literature. Anti-VEGF agent product labeling and other
literature discuss techniques of intravitreal injection.278, 279, 320-322
As is the case with most clinical trials, these treatment trials do not provide clear guidance for 
the management of all patients encountered in clinical practice. The first major prospective 
randomized anti-VEGF treatment trials (Anti-VEGF Antibody for the Treatment of 
Predominantly Classic CNV in AMD [ANCHOR], Minimally Classic/Occult Trial of the Anti-
VEGF Antibody Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Neovascular AMD [MARINA], VIEW, 
CATT, IVAN, and HARBOR) used either a fixed continuous treatment regimen (approximately 
every 4 or 8 weeks) or an individualized discontinuous treatment regimen (as-needed or PRN  
treatment).218, 225, 236, 237, 240, 242, 243, 323 Choice of the treatment strategy to use should be 
individually tailored based on discussion between the patient and physician. 
The PRN regimens using ranibizumab appear to have efficacy and safety comparable to fixed 
monthly regimens over 1 year of treatment, but they do not maintain the initial visual gains with 
longer follow-up.240, 241 Caution should be used when dosing PRN bevacizumab, as it may be 
slightly less effective than other monthly anti-VEGF regimens and other PRN anti-VEGF 
regimens.240 Vision gains during the first 2 years of the CATT clinical trials were not 
maintained at the 5-year follow-up visit, but 50% of the patients maintained a VA of 20/40.241 
A continuous, variable dosing regimen that attempts to individualize therapy, commonly 
referred to as treat-and-extend, is frequently used in clinical practice as an alternative to the two 
treatment approaches above.324-327 Prospective studies such as Lucentis Compared to Avastin 
Study (LUCAS) have shown similar efficacy between monthly and treat-and-extend for 
bevacizumab and ranibizumab.328  
Personalized treatment interval dosing regimens, which are based on treat-and-extend and use 
prespecified criteria, maintain visual and anatomic improvements while allowing for extended 
dosing intervals in clinical studies evaluating faricimab and aflibercept 8 mg.219, 233   
Subretinal hemorrhages are relatively common in neovascular AMD. Small subretinal 
hemorrhages are a sign of active MNV or PCV and may be managed with anti-VEGF therapy. 
For the management of larger submacular hemorrhages, the Submacular Surgery Trial study 
was inconclusive.159  Pneumatic displacement procedures, the use of tissue plasminogen 
activator (tPA), and/or pars plana vitrectomy have been proposed. The data on management of 
these larger hemorrhages are inadequate to make a recommendation at this time.329

All anti-VEGF treatments may carry theoretical risks for systemic arterial thromboembolic 
events (ATEs) and increased intraocular pressure, although the results of clinical trials studying 
these risks remain inconclusive.205, 246, 247, 335-338 A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis 
found that intravitreal anti-VEGF agent use did not increase major cardiovascular events, but 
there were increased nonocular hemorrhages in patients with AMD.337 (I+, Moderate quality) 
Another systematic review with meta-analyses concluded that anti-VEGF treatment intensity 
had no significant influence on mortality.338 (I+, Moderate quality) A review of the literature 
concluded that anti-VEGF therapy is safe and effective for neovascular AMD.339 The risks of 
intravitreal anti-VEGF agents in pregnant or lactating women have not been studied.340, 341 
Intravitreal pharmacotherapy can result in endophthalmitis, noninfectious inflammation, retinal 
tear, or detachment. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents are discussed below. 
Aflibercept 2 mg 
Endophthalmitis had a cumulative incidence of 1.0% or less over 1 year in VIEW 
studies.218 The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in neovascular AMD 
studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of 
patients treated with aflibercept 2 mg compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients 
treated with ranibizumab. Through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) 
in the aflibercept 2-mg group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab 
group.213 Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in 
less than 0.1% of intravitreal injections with aflibercept 2 mg, including 
endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) 
reported in patients receiving aflibercept 2 mg were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, 
cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and increased intraocular pressure. At 1 
year, there were no statistically significant differences in rates of serious systemic 
adverse events such as death, arteriothrombotic events, or venous thrombotic events 
between ranibizumab and aflibercept.218, 342 Aflibercept was found to have a 0% to 
0.16% rate of intraocular inflammation (not counting endophthalmitis).343 
Aflibercept 8 mg 
The safety profile for aflibercept 8 mg was similar to aflibercept 2 mg at 48 weeks. The 
incidence of reported thromboembolic events from baseline through week 48 was 0.4% 
(3 out of 673) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg.219 The 
most common adverse reactions (≥3%) reported in patients treated with aflibercept 8 
mg were cataract, conjunctival hemorrhage, increased intraocular pressure, ocular 
discomfort/eye pain/eye irritation, blurred vision, vitreous floaters, vitreous detachment, 
corneal epithelium defect, and retinal hemorrhage.213   
Bevacizumab 
Reported safety data are limited by relatively short and variable follow-up periods and 
by differences in reporting criteria.344, 345 Reported ocular adverse events include 
bacterial endophthalmitis (0.16%) per injection, tractional retinal detachments (0.16%), 
uveitis (0.09%), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (0.02%), and vitreous hemorrhage 
(0.16%).321, 346 Bevacizumab was found to have a 0.081% to 0.10% rate of intraocular 
inflammation (not counting endophthalmitis).343 
At 1 year, the CATT study had no statistically significant differences in rates of death, 
arteriothrombotic events, or venous thrombotic events for the two drugs, but there was

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P41 
limited statistical power. There was a higher rate of serious systemic events (e.g., 
arteriothrombotic events, venous thrombosis, or gastrointestinal disorders such as 
hemorrhage) among patients treated with bevacizumab compared with ranibizumab 
(24% vs. 19%; P = 0.04), and this statistically significant difference was persistent at 2 
years of follow-up.225, 240 The IVAN trial showed greater serum VEGF suppression with 
bevacizumab but did not show any statistically significant difference in serious 
systemic adverse events.242 
Brolucizumab 
Although HAWK and HARRIER found a 2.1% incidence of retinal vasculitis with 
retinal vascular occlusion, postmarketing surveillance revealed a higher incidence of 
intraocular inflammation.230, 347   
Arterial thromboembolic events occurred in 1.1% and 1.4% of the patients in the 3-mg 
and 6-mg study groups of HAWK study, respectively, and in 1.6% of the 
brolucizumab patients in HARRIER study. Among them, four patients in the 3-mg 
group and six patients in the 6-mg group had retinal artery occlusion and all of them 
had cardiovascular comorbidities such as hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias. The 
other mentioned adverse effects in the study were retinal hemorrhage, cataract, dry 
eye, eye pain, posterior capsule opacification, increased intraocular pressure, 
blepharitis, retinal pigment epithelial tear, punctate keratitis, corneal abrasion, 
conjunctivitis, and macular fibrosis.230   
Faricimab 
The incidence of reported ATEs during the first year was 1% (7 out of 664) in patients 
treated with faricimab compared with 1% (6 out of 662) in patients treated with 
aflibercept. The risk of endophthalmitis was less than 1%.235 Recently, case reports of 
intraocular inflammation (excluding endophthalmitis) with faricimab were as high as 
2% and retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion were 0.17 per 10,000 injections 
(vasculitis) and 0.06 per 10,000 for occlusive vasculitis.348 
Ranibizumab 
The incidence of endophthalmitis was cumulative 1.0% or less over 2 years in the 
MARINA study and less than 1.0% over 1 year in ANCHOR study. There was a per 
injection rate of endophthalmitis of 0.05% in MARINA.236 Retinal detachment or 
traumatic injury to the lens occurred in less than 0.1% of treated cases during the first 
year of treatment.236, 237 Ranibizumab was found to have a 0.081% to 0.10% rate of 
intraocular inflammation (not counting endophthalmitis). 
Ranibizumab Ocular Implant 
The ranibizumab implant has been associated with a threefold higher rate of 
endophthalmitis than monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. Many of these 
events were associated with conjunctival retractions or erosions. Appropriate 
conjunctiva management and early detection with surgical repair of conjunctival 
retractions or erosions may reduce the risk of endophthalmitis. In clinical trials, 2.0% of 
patients receiving a ranibizumab implant experienced at least one episode of 
endophthalmitis. Patients had a 5.2% risk of vitreous hemorrhage, which resolved 
spontaneously.349 
Biosimilars 
Ophthalmic biosimilars require one comparative trial of 9 months or more for AMD 
demonstrating safety and efficacy compared with the reference product.269 They have 
no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product except in inactive 
components, or excipients, which can have implications for safety.269 Ranibizumab-
nuna and ranibizumab-eqrn were found to have comparable safety profiles to that of 
ranibizumab in randomized phase 3 clinical trials.265, 266 Similarly, aflibercept-yszy

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P42 
demonstrated a similar safety profile to that of aflibercept 2 mg in a randomized phase 
3 study.350 
Verteporfin Photodynamic Therapy 
Possible complications of verteporfin photodynamic therapy include the following: 
A severe decrease in central vision occurred within 1 week following treatment in 1% to
4% of patients, which may be permanent270, 332, 333
Infusion site extravasation
Idiosyncratic back pain during infusion of the drug (1%–2% of patients)270, 332, 333
Photosensitivity reaction (<3% of patients).270, 332, 333 The stated, current recommendations
are to avoid direct sunlight for the first 5 days after a treatment.
Verteporfin is contraindicated in patients with porphyria or a known allergy or sensitivity
to the drug. Careful consideration should be given to patients with liver dysfunction and to
patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or of pediatric age, because these patients were
not studied in published reports.351
Thermal Laser Photocoagulation Surgery
Possible complications of the thermal laser surgery modality include the following:
Severe vision loss following treatment, which may be permanent
Rupture of Bruch’s membrane with subretinal or vitreous hemorrhage
Thermal laser is no longer recommended for subfoveal MNV.
Antioxidant Vitamin and Mineral Supplements
Possible complications of high-dose beta-carotene are as follows:
Self-reported yellowing of the skin (8.3% in the antioxidant arm compared with 6.0% in
the no antioxidant arm; P = 0.008)5
Increased risk of developing lung cancer in current smokers (an excess cumulative
incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively
thereafter, resulting in an 18% difference in incidence by the end of the study (95% CI,
3%–36%; P = 0.01) between the patients who received beta-carotene and those who did
not.191 The active treatment group had a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.04–
1.57; P = 0.02) compared with the placebo group.192
Possible complications of high-dose zinc supplements include the following:
Increased risk of hospitalizations for genitourinary causes (i.e., unspecified urinary tract
infection and prostatic hyperplasia in men and stress incontinence in women) were 7.5% in
those treated with zinc compared with 4.9% in those not treated with 80 mg of zinc; P =
0.001.5 In the AREDS2, there was no significant difference in AMD progression between
80 mg and 25 mg of zinc.
Copper-deficiency anemia (concomitant administration of copper is necessary according to
the AREDS and AREDS2)
When considering long-term supplementation, some people may have reason to avoid one
or more of the supplements evaluated in the original AREDS or AREDS2. Because of the
potential adverse effects, such as increased rate of genitourinary conditions that may
require hospitalizations, the high doses of antioxidant vitamins and minerals recommended
by the original AREDS and AREDS2 should be reviewed by the patient’s primary care
physician.

Follow-up Evaluation 
A history and examination are the recommended elements of the follow-up visits, and the 
recommended follow-up intervals are listed in Table 6. 
History  
The follow-up history should take into account the following: 
Symptoms, including decreased vision and metamorphopsia275
Changes in medications and nutritional supplements
Changes in medical and ocular history13, 276, 277
Changes in social history (smoking)38-42
Examination
The examination on the follow-up visit should include the following:
Visual acuity at distance with correction
Amsler grid
Stereoscopic biomicroscopic examination of the fundus
Follow-up after Treatment for Neovascular Age-Related Macular
Degeneration
In addition to the above recommendations, patients who have been treated with intravitreal
injections, verteporfin PDT, or thermal laser photocoagulation surgery should be examined
at regular intervals by means of biomicroscopy of the fundus. Optical coherence
tomography,281 OCTA,352-355 fluorescein angiography,174, 176, 177 and fundus photography
may be helpful to detect signs of active exudation or disease progression and should be
used when clinically indicated. In common clinical practice, OCT is a simple, noninvasive
procedure that is well accepted by the patient and provides important information for the
provider to manage AMD.
Initial treatment and follow-up with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy should be at
approximately 4-week intervals.206-217, 229 Subsequent follow-up and treatment intervals
vary depending on the clinical findings and judgment of the treating ophthalmologist. After
three loading doses administered at 4-week intervals, a maintenance treatment regimen
every 8 weeks with aflibercept 2 mg has been shown to have comparable efficacy to every
4 weeks of either ranibizumab and aflibercept 2 mg in the first year of therapy.218 There are
numerous protocols: monthly or bimonthly injections, treat-and-extend, PRN, or
personalized treatment interval. There is no consensus about the ideal treatment intervals
with anti-VEGF agents, and the physician can tailor treatment on an individual patient
basis.
Subsequent examinations, OCT, OCTA, and fluorescein angiography should be performed
as indicated depending on the clinical findings and the judgment of the treating
ophthalmologist. Treated patients should be instructed to report symptoms of
endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or decreased vision, and they should be re-examined
promptly.
Real-world treatment tends to fall short of clinical trial guidelines and protocols, and it
results in worse outcomes. A systematic review found multiple factors contributing to
nonadherence and nonpersistence in neovascular AMD treatment, including poorer vision
at baseline and less than optimal treatment response.356 (II-, Moderate quality) Another
systematic review of intravitreal injection therapy found that worse vision at baseline,
worsening of vision, age, and distance from a treatment center were associated with
nonadherence.357 (II-, Moderate quality) Loss to follow-up is not uncommon in patients
with neovascular AMD. One study found that 1 out of 9 patients undergoing treatment with


--- Página 44 ---

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P44 
anti-VEGF injections was lost to follow-up. Risk factors included increased age, male sex, 
unilateral involvement, diabetes, Medicaid insurance, and race and ethnicity.358-360  
Fellow Eyes without Macular Neovascularization 
For patients with unilateral disease, the fellow eye without MNV remains at high risk of 
developing advanced AMD.361 The risk can be lowered by as much as 36% over a 10-year 
period by taking the AREDS/AREDS2 supplements.5 Patients should be instructed to 
monitor their vision and to return to the ophthalmologist periodically, even in the absence 
of symptoms, but promptly after the onset of any new or significant visual symptoms. 
Patients at exceptionally high risk (e.g., those who have advanced AMD in one eye and 
large drusen with RPE changes in the fellow eye) may be examined more frequently (i.e., 
every 6–12 months) in an effort to detect asymptomatic MNV at a treatable stage. Since 
some patients with AMD also have cognitive impairment, a family member or care 
assistant should prompt the patient to self-test. Optical coherence tomography is useful and 
OCTA may be useful for evaluating the status of high-risk fellow eyes. 
PROVIDER AND SETTING 
Ophthalmologists, optometrists, and ancillary clinical personnel should be aware that patients with the 
onset of new symptoms suggestive of AMD (e.g., new visual loss, metamorphopsia, or scotoma) 
should be examined promptly. The ophthalmologist should perform the examination, order 
appropriate testing, and administer all treatment and anti-VEGF injections, and certain aspects of the 
testing may be conducted by other trained individuals under the ophthalmologist's supervision. The 
American Academy of Ophthalmology has a stated position and a policy statement on the role of the 
ophthalmologist in the delivery of intravitreal agents.362  
COUNSELING AND REFERRAL 
All patients with AMD should be educated about the prognosis of the disease and the potential value 
of treatment as appropriate for their visual and functional status. Patients can be informed that while 
central visual loss is common, total visual loss is extremely rare. Patients with AMD can be reassured 
that there is no harm in using their eyes for normal visual tasks, and they may be told that the effect of 
total sunlight exposure remains uncertain. Insofar as cigarette smoking is a key modifiable risk factor, 
smoking cessation is strongly recommended when advising patients with AMD or at risk for AMD. 
The informed consent process should include a discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment and 
treatment alternatives. Patients should be told that these are treatments not cures for neovascular 
AMD and ongoing follow-up is essential to maintain the best possible vision. The off-label status of 
bevacizumab for neovascular AMD should be included in the discussion; information and a consent 
form are available from the Ophthalmic Mutual Insurance Company.229 
Vision rehabilitation optimizes the patient’s functional ability,363 and patients with reduced visual 
function should be referred for vision rehabilitation and social services.364 Empathic communication 
and questioning by the provider is helpful to elicit patient concerns. Referrals for counseling, 
vocational rehabilitation, and or peer support groups for patients with depression, anxiety, and loss of 
independence or employment should be considered.365 Patients with severe visual loss related to AMD 
who are referred for vision rehabilitation services often have unrealistic expectations. Educating 
patients that the visual rehabilitation specialist helps to optimize their existing visual function rather 
than “helping them see better” will establish more appropriate expectations around such services. 
Special optical or electronic magnifying lenses, bright lights, and electronic reading aids may help 
patients to read more effectively but not as well as they did before the onset of AMD. An Implantable 
Miniature Telescope (IMT) is an FDA-approved device that may be effective for screened, phakic, 
motivated patients with end-stage AMD.366, 367 A systematic review in 2018 found insufficient 
evidence on the IMT’s safety and effectiveness in patients with late or advanced AMD.344 (III, 
Insufficient evidence) More information on vision rehabilitation, including materials for patients, is 
available at www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab.

Loss of VA increases the risk of frequent falls.368, 369 Depression and visual hallucinations (Charles 
Bonnet syndrome) frequently accompany severe central vision loss. Patients who have Charles 
Bonnet syndrome and their family members should be informed that visual symptoms are not unusual 
and do not represent a sign of psychosis or mental deterioration. Age-related macular degeneration is 
associated with depression and reduced vision-related quality of life.370 The ophthalmologist may 
inquire about symptoms of clinical depression and, when appropriate, suggest that the patient seek 
professional advice, as depression may exacerbate the effects of AMD.371  
SOCIOECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS 
The considerable burden of disease associated with AMD, as well as the public health benefits of 
prevention, are highlighted in analyses conducted by the AREDS authors. This research, published in 
2003, estimated that 8 million Americans aged 55 and older are at high risk for developing advanced 
AMD. If these persons received AREDS-formulation supplements, it was estimated that 
approximately 300,000 would avoid advanced AMD and any associated vision loss over a 5-year 
period.372 The Salisbury Eye Study reported that VA loss adversely affected activities of daily living, 
which subsequently increased mortality risk in older adults. Further calculations estimated that 
treating AMD with anti-VEGF agents saves 1 to 2 years of life.373 
More cost-effectiveness studies on the use of anti-VEGF therapies have demonstrated that they are 
highly cost-effective over prior therapies such as PDT.374 375-378 The off-label use of intravitreal 
bevacizumab was suggested to represent a highly cost-effective, off-label option for management of 
neovascular AMD compared with the higher cost of ranibizumab.377 Others have investigated the cost 
utility of various treatments for AMD. One analysis using CATT trial data found that bevacizumab 
with PRN dosing offered considerably greater value than ranibizumab in the treatment of neovascular 
AMD among patients 80 and older.378 Another analysis using CATT and MARINA data evaluated the 
relative 10-year cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab and ranibizumab in 65-year-old patients with 
neovascular AMD. This study estimated the cost utility of bevacizumab treatment (relative to no 
treatment) at approximately $2,700 per quality-adjusted life year ([QALY] for monthly dosing) and 
$3,300 per QALY (for PRN dosing). In contrast, the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab was estimated 
as $63,300/QALY for monthly dosing and $18,600 per QALY for PRN dosing.375 Wholesale prices of 
anti-VEGF medications range from $50 to $1,950 per dose, depending on the medication.375-378  The 
use of personalized anti-VEGF treatment guided by OCT has resulted in savings for the U.S. 
government of $9 billion and $22 billion for patients with neovascular AMD, respectively, in a study 
comparing patient and Medicare savings.379  
After the FDA approval of the ranibizumab ocular implant, Brown et al evaluated the cost-
effectiveness of this new treatment.380 They found that although the implant seemed to compare 
favorably at $21,825 with two ranibizumab 100-mg/ml fills at 1 year compared with $18,405 for 11.8 
injections of ranibizumab 0.5 mg over that same time period, this benefit did not seem to extend to 5- 
and 12-year time points. Both treatments were cost-effective compared with no treatment, however. 
One study developed a drug-pricing model using the Medicare average sales price for bevacizumab, 
ranibizumab, and aflibercept 2 mg, wholesale acquisition costs of currently available ranibizumab 
biosimilars, and postulated prices for bevacizumab and aflibercept biosimilars. Results from this 
model indicated increased costs from a bevacizumab biosimilar and cost reductions from ranibizumab 
and aflibercept biosimilars. Medicare Part B average sales prices for ranibizumab 0.3 mg, 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg, and aflibercept 2 mg were $776, $1,292, and $1,806, respectively, as of October 
2022. The respective wholesale acquisition costs for biosimilar versions of the two dosages of 
ranibizumab were $816 and $1,130 to $1,360. The model predicted that a bevacizumab biosimilar 
priced at $500 would increase Medicare Part B costs by $457 million annually, and one priced at $900 
would increase costs by $897 million annually. However, switching from ranibizumab and aflibercept 
2 mg to their biosimilars could lead to total cost savings of $132 million for Medicare.381  
Since the FDA approved pegcetacoplan for GA, the cost-effectiveness of this new treatment was 
evaluated.382 Based on 2022 Medicare reimbursement data, the authors of the study found that the cost 
of the two treatment frequencies varied. The cost per area of delaying GA for 2 years with monthly 
treatment was $87,300/mm2, compared with EOM treatment, which cost $49,200/mm2. The costs for 
extrafoveal GA had greater utility, with costs of $53,900/mm2 for those treated monthly compared

with $32,100/mm2 in the EOM group. Their model also predicted that 95% atrophy was delayed by 
2.5 years in patients treated monthly compared with 2.1 years in the EOM group.

APPENDIX 1. QUALITY OF OPHTHALMIC 
CARE CORE CRITERIA
Providing quality care 
is the physician's foremost ethical obligation, and is 
the basis of public trust in physicians. 
AMA Board of Trustees, 1986 
Quality ophthalmic care is provided in a manner and with the skill that is consistent with the best interests of 
the patient. The discussion that follows characterizes the core elements of such care.  
The ophthalmologist is first and foremost a physician. As such, the ophthalmologist demonstrates 
compassion and concern for the individual and utilizes the science and art of medicine to help alleviate 
patient fear and suffering. The ophthalmologist strives to develop and maintain clinical skills at the highest 
feasible level, consistent with the needs of patients, through training and continuing education. The 
ophthalmologist evaluates those skills and medical knowledge in relation to the needs of the patient and 
responds accordingly. The ophthalmologist also ensures that needy patients receive necessary care directly or 
through referral to appropriate persons and facilities that will provide such care, and he or she supports 
activities that promote health and prevent disease and disability. 
The ophthalmologist recognizes that disease places patients in a disadvantaged, dependent state. The 
ophthalmologist respects the dignity and integrity of his or her patients and does not exploit their 
vulnerability. 
Quality ophthalmic care has the following optimal attributes, among others. 
 The essence of quality care is a meaningful partnership relationship between patient and physician. The
ophthalmologist strives to communicate effectively with his or her patients, listening carefully to their
needs and concerns. In turn, the ophthalmologist educates his or her patients about the nature and
prognosis of their condition and about proper and appropriate therapeutic modalities. This is to ensure
their meaningful participation (appropriate to their unique physical, intellectual, and emotional state) in
decisions affecting their management and care, to improve their motivation and compliance with the
agreed plan of treatment, and to help alleviate their fears and concerns.
 The ophthalmologist uses his or her best judgment in choosing and timing appropriate diagnostic and
therapeutic modalities as well as the frequency of evaluation and follow-up, with due regard to the
urgency and nature of the patient's condition and unique needs and desires.
 The ophthalmologist carries out only those procedures for which he or she is adequately trained,
experienced, and competent, or, when necessary, is assisted by someone who is, depending on the
urgency of the problem and availability and accessibility of alternative providers.
 Patients are assured access to, and continuity of, needed and appropriate ophthalmic care, which can be
described as follows.
The ophthalmologist treats patients with due regard to timeliness, appropriateness, and his or her own
ability to provide such care.
The operating ophthalmologist makes adequate provision for appropriate pre- and postoperative
patient care.
When the ophthalmologist is unavailable for his or her patient, he or she provides appropriate alternate
ophthalmic care, with adequate mechanisms for informing patients of the existence of such care and
procedures for obtaining it.
The ophthalmologist refers patients to other ophthalmologists and eye care providers based on the
timeliness and appropriateness of such referral, the patient's needs, the competence and qualifications
of the person to whom the referral is made, and access and availability.
The ophthalmologist seeks appropriate consultation with due regard to the nature of the ocular or other
medical or surgical problem. Consultants are suggested for their skill, competence, and accessibility.
They receive as complete and accurate an accounting of the problem as necessary to provide efficient
and effective advice or intervention, and in turn they respond in an adequate and timely manner. The
ophthalmologist maintains complete and accurate medical records.


--- Página 48 ---

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P48 
On appropriate request, the ophthalmologist provides a full and accurate rendering of the patient's
records in his or her possession.
The ophthalmologist reviews the results of consultations and laboratory tests in a timely and effective
manner and takes appropriate actions.
The ophthalmologist and those who assist in providing care identify themselves and their profession.
For patients whose conditions fail to respond to treatment and for whom further treatment is
unavailable, the ophthalmologist provides proper professional support, counseling, rehabilitative and
social services, and referral as appropriate and accessible.
 Prior to therapeutic or invasive diagnostic procedures, the ophthalmologist becomes appropriately
conversant with the patient's condition by collecting pertinent historical information and performing
relevant preoperative examinations. Additionally, he or she enables the patient to reach a fully informed
decision by providing an accurate and truthful explanation of the diagnosis; the nature, purpose, risks,
benefits, and probability of success of the proposed treatment and of alternative treatment; and the risks
and benefits of no treatment.
 The ophthalmologist adopts new technology (e.g., drugs, devices, surgical techniques) in judicious
fashion, appropriate to the cost and potential benefit relative to existing alternatives and to its
demonstrated safety and efficacy.
 The ophthalmologist enhances the quality of care he or she provides by periodically reviewing and
assessing his or her personal performance in relation to established standards, and by revising or altering
his or her practices and techniques appropriately.
 The ophthalmologist improves ophthalmic care by communicating to colleagues, through appropriate
professional channels, knowledge gained through clinical research and practice. This includes alerting
colleagues of instances of unusual or unexpected rates of complications and problems related to new
drugs, devices, or procedures.
 The ophthalmologist provides care in suitably staffed and equipped facilities adequate to deal with
potential ocular and systemic complications requiring immediate attention.
 The ophthalmologist also provides ophthalmic care in a manner that is cost effective without
unacceptably compromising accepted standards of quality.

GLOSSARY 
Advanced AMD (Advanced age-related macular degeneration): This is the most severe form of AMD, 
defined as GA involving the center of the macula (fovea) or features of CNV. 
AMD (Age-related macular degeneration): There is no universally accepted definition of this term. The 
condition is characterized by the presence of drusen and alterations of the RPE as well as by the fundus 
abnormalities associated with CNV, and it generally occurs in persons over age 65. The VA may vary from 
normal to severe impairment. 
Amsler grid: This is a graph paper with a central dot for fixation. While viewing this central spot, the patient 
is asked to evaluate vision for the early signs of metamorphopsia by looking for any changes in the grid.  
ANCHOR Study: Anti-VEGF antibody (ranibizumab) for the treatment of predominantly classic CNV in 
AMD study.  
Anti-VEGF (Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor): Substances that inhibit the action of vascular 
endothelial growth factor protein. 
AREDS (Age-Related Eye Disease Study): A prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to 
assess the natural course and risk factors of age-related cataract and AMD and the effects of antioxidants and 
minerals on these two conditions. 
AREDS2 (Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2): A prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of 4000 
participants designed to assess the effects of oral supplementation of high doses of macular xanthophylls 
(lutein and zeaxanthin) and/or omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid and 
eicosapentaenoic acid) for the treatment of AMD and cataract. All participants were offered the AREDS 
supplements. A secondary randomization evaluated the possibility of deleting beta-carotene and decreasing 
the original levels of zinc in the AREDS formulation. Follow-up occurs over 5 years. 
Bevacizumab: A full-length monoclonal antibody that binds all isoforms of VEGF and has FDA approval for 
intravenous use in the treatment of metastatic colorectal, metastatic breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. 
CATT (Comparison of AMD Treatment Trials): A multicenter clinical trial that compared the safety and 
efficacy of bevacizumab and ranibizumab and an individualized dosing regimen (PRN) to monthly 
injections. 
Classic choroidal neovascularization: The angiographic findings in which the CNV is recognized in the 
early phase of the fluorescein angiogram as an area of bright, well-demarcated hyperfluorescence and during 
the late phases of the angiogram as progressive pooling of dye in the overlying subsensory retinal space. 
Usually considered a Gass Type 2 membrane. 
CNV (Choroidal neovascularization): Synonymous with subretinal or choroidal neovascular membrane. 
These are vessels from the choriocapillaris that perforate and grow through Bruch’s membrane and enter the 
subretinal pigment epithelial and/or subretinal spaces.  
DENALI study: Part of the SUMMIT studies, this trial compares ranibizumab and verteporfin PDT 
combination therapy with ranibizumab alone. 
DERBY study: Phase 3 clinical trial for pegcetacoplan (complement C3 inhibitor) compared with sham 
injections in patients with GA. 
Disc area: As defined by the Macular Photocoagulation Study, the area of a circle with a diameter of 1.5 mm 
(1500 µm) equal to 1.77 square mm. The area on a photograph will vary with the type of fundus camera used. 
Disciform scar: Subretinal fibrovascular tissue that usually becomes more fibrous within a few years and that 
is often the end result of CNV.

P52 
Drusen: Yellow lesions at the level of the basement membrane of the RPE. They are the ophthalmoscopic 
and histologic hallmark of AMD. They are considered to be small if they are less than 63 µm in diameter, 
intermediate if they are greater than or equal to 63 and less than or equal to 125 µm, and large when the 
diameter is greater than 125 µm, and they may be considered soft if they have ill-defined edges. 
EVEREST study: A study conducted in Asia that investigated combination PDT and anti-VEGF therapy. 
Extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization: A choroidal neovascular membrane that comes no closer than 
200 µm from the center of the foveal avascular zone, as defined by the Macular Photocoagulation Study.  
Foveal avascular zone: An area usually 300 to 500 µm in diameter centered on the foveola and lacking 
retinal blood vessels, also known as the capillary-free zone.

choriocapillaris atrophy. Drusen are usually present surrounding these zones and there may be surrounding 
pigment clumping. This is an advanced form of AMD when the center of the fovea is involved. 
GATHER study: Phase 3 clinical trial for avacincapad pegol (complement C5 inhibitor) compared with sham 
injections in patients with GA

diagnostic evaluation to visualize CNV. 
IVAN trial (Inhibition of VEGF in Age-related choroidal Neovascularization): A 2-year study conducted 
in the United Kingdom that compared intravitreal bevacizumab with ranibizumab dosed either on a 
continuous (monthly) or discontinuous (PRN) basis.  
Juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization: Well-demarcated CNV that is between 1 µm and 199 µm from 
the center of the foveal avascular zone but that does not reach its center, as defined by the Macular 
Photocoagulation Study.

another area of more intact RPE.  
MARINA study: Study of minimally classic/occult trial of the anti-VEGF antibody, ranibizumab, in the 
treatment of neovascular AMD. 
MNV:  Macular neovascularization historically referred to as CNV and includes the following

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P53 
 
PCV: Similar to Type 1 MNV, characterized by branching vascular networks with dilated
vascular elements (historically referred to as polyps)
 
Type 2 MNV: neovascular complex located in the subretinal space above the RPE
originating from the choroid
 
Type 3 MNV: pathologic angiogenesis originating from deep retinal capillary plexus
extending to the outer retina (historically referred to as retinal angiomatous proliferation)

histoplasmosis, and idiopathic causes. 
Neovascular macular degeneration: Manifestations of CNV and/or RPE detachment associated with 
subretinal serous fluid, exudates, and/or blood.  
OAKS: Phase 3 clinical trial for pegcetacoplan (complement C3 inhibitor) compared with sham in patients 
with GA. 
Occult choroidal neovascularization: Angiographic findings characterized by a fibrovascular RPE 
detachment and/or late leakage of an undetermined source. This is also referred to as poorly defined CNV 
that has indistinct or poorly demarcated boundaries on fluorescein angiography. Usually considered a Gass 
Type 1 membrane. 
OCT (Optical coherence tomography): A noninvasive technique to image intraocular tissues by measuring 
the echo time delay and intensity of back-reflected light. The resulting image provides high-resolution, cross-
sectional representation of structure with near-histological detail. 
OCTA (Optical coherence tomography angiography): A noninvasive imaging technique for the 
microvasculature of the retina and choroid. 
PCV (Polypoidal choroidopathy): Characterized by multiple and recurrent serosanguineous RPE 
detachments, which often resemble hemorrhagic detachment in AMD. A fluorescein angiogram and ICG 
may be helpful in distinguishing these conditions.  
PDT (Photodynamic therapy): A method of treating CNV in a two-part process involving systemic 
administration of a photosensitizing drug followed by nonthermal light application to the macular pathology. 
PED (Pigment epithelial detachment): Accumulation of fluid (serous RPE detachment) or blood 
(hemorrhagic RPE detachment) beneath the RPE. Associated CNV is usually present in older patients and/or 
patients with drusen. Another form is the fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment, which is a form of 
occult CNV.  
Pegaptanib sodium (Macugen): A compound that binds to a specific isoform of vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF165) and thus blocks its activity. It is administered by intravitreal injection. 
Persistent choroidal neovascularization: Angiographically documented CNV found within 6 weeks of laser 
surgery, typically but not always at the site of the previously treated CNV, according to the Macular 
Photocoagulation Study definition.  
PGF (Placental growth factor): A growth factor related to VEGF that may play a role in ocular 
angiogenesis. 
Predominantly classic lesion: CNV in which classic CNV occupies more than 50% of the entire lesion area. 
PULSAR: Phase 3 clinical trial for aflibercept 8 mg compared with aflibercept 2 mg for patients with 
neovascular AMD.

Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP 
P54 
Ranibizumab (Lucentis): A recombinant humanized immunoglobulin G1 kappa isotype therapeutic antibody 
fragment that binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of a form of VEGF-A. 
Recurrent choroidal neovascularization: Angiographically documented CNV found more than 6 weeks after 
laser surgery and typically occurring on the perimeter of the previous treatment scar, as defined by the 
Macular Photocoagulation Study.  
Reticular pseudodrusen: Also referred to as subretinal drusenoid deposits. 
Retinal angiomatous proliferation: See Subretinal drusenoid deposits. 
RPE abnormalities (Retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities): Alterations of the retinal pigment 
epithelium-Bruch’s membrane complex that lead to an appearance of hypopigmentation and/or 
hyperpigmentation. Its extreme form is GA.  
Severe visual loss: In this document, severe visual loss means quadrupling or more of the visual angle (e.g., 
20/20 to 20/80 or worse, or 20/50 to 20/200 or worse).  
Subfoveal choroidal neovascularization: Choroidal neovascularization that underlies the center of the foveal 
avascular zone.  
Submacular Surgery Tria): A trial conducted in the mid-1990s, prior to the emergence of currently used 
therapies, that evaluated the efficacy of submacular surgery for treating complications of CNV and subretinal 
hemorrhage. 
Subretinal drusenoid deposits: Characterized by proliferation of retinal capillaries in the paramacular area 
that may present as intraretinal, subretinal, or CNV. 
SUMMIT: Two studies, called DENALI in North America and MONT BLANC in Europe, that compare 
ranibizumab and verteporfin PDT combination therapy with ranibizumab alone. 
TENAYA: Phase 3 clinical trial for faricimab compared with aflibercept 2 mg in patients with neovascular 
AMD. 
VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor): A significant mediator in the process of angiogenesis and 
increased vascular permeability and inflammation. It has been identified in neovascularization related to both 
diabetic retinopathy and AMD. In animal models, the introduction of VEGF has initiated the cascade of 
neovascularization seen in AMD. Thus, the inhibition or antagonism of the action of VEGF is a targeted area 
of research, with several novel therapeutic agents being developed, and in various stages of investigation and 
FDA approval. 
Verteporfin (Visudyne): A drug used as a photosensitizer in conjunction with a nonthermal PDT laser. 
VIEW Study: Phase 3 clinical trial for aflibercept 2 mg compared with ranibizumab in patients with
